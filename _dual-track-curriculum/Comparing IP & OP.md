### Similarities and Differences between IP and OP Tracks

Click [here](https://staging.d26k7rl81eo6rb.amplifyapp.com/dual-track-curriculum/Integrated-Programme/overview/) if you want to learn more about our IP that is co-designed and offered together with our **Joint Integrated Programme (JIP) partner schools**: **[About the JIP](https://staging.d26k7rl81eo6rb.amplifyapp.com/dual-track-curriculum/Integrated-Programme/overview/)**

**Rich and diverse student development and enrichment opportunities** are offered by CHS to both IP and OP track students as far as possible to complete our students’ education experience, e.g. Passion Pursuit (Elective) modules are offered to both IP and OP students.

The more significant differentiation is that **IP students have more time than OP students for learning news skills and knowledge or participating in experiential learning**, e.g. going on immersion trips in Year 4. OP students have to prepare and sit for the O-Level examinations in Sec 4.
