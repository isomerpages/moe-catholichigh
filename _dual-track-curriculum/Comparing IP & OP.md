### Similarities and Differences between IP and OP Tracks

Click [here](https://staging.d26k7rl81eo6rb.amplifyapp.com/dual-track-curriculum/Integrated-Programme/overview/) if you want to learn more about our IP that is co-designed and offered together with our **Joint Integrated Programme (JIP) partner schools**: **[About the JIP](https://staging.d26k7rl81eo6rb.amplifyapp.com/dual-track-curriculum/Integrated-Programme/overview/)**

**Rich and diverse student development and enrichment opportunities** are offered by CHS to both IP and OP track students as far as possible to complete our students’ education experience, e.g. Passion Pursuit (Elective) modules are offered to both IP and OP students.

The more significant differentiation is that **IP students have more time than OP students for learning news skills and knowledge or participating in experiential learning**, e.g. going on immersion trips in Year 4. OP students have to prepare and sit for the O-Level examinations in Sec 4.

The following diagram provides an overview of our Dual Track curriculum, and highlights some of our signature programmes such as:

#### IP-specfic Curriculum & Programmes

IP students will undertake a rigorous curriculum that have more extension of learning than OP. In addition, IP lessons will differ from OP in terms of **IP-specific pedagogy and assessments**. IP students will also offer additional subjects such as our **unique IP flagship** **[World Readiness Programme](https://staging.d26k7rl81eo6rb.amplifyapp.com/secondary/Distinctive-Programmes/world-readiness-programme/)** and **[Passion Pursuit (Independent)](https://staging.d26k7rl81eo6rb.amplifyapp.com/secondary/Distinctive-Programmes/passion-pursuit/independent/)**. In addition, IP students may participate in JIP Student Leadership Development programmes. Prospective students may want to take note that **[MOE Bicultural Studies Programme](https://staging.d26k7rl81eo6rb.amplifyapp.com/secondary/Talent-Development/bicultural-studies-programme/)** is offered to only IP students due to the students’ availability in Year 4 for overseas study trips and other programmes.
