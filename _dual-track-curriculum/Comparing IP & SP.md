### Similarities and Differences between IP and SP Tracks

Click&nbsp;[here](/dual-track-curriculum/Integrated-Programme/overview/)&nbsp;if you want to learn more about our IP that is co-designed and offered together with our&nbsp;**Joint Integrated&nbsp;Programme&nbsp;(JIP) partner schools**:&nbsp;**[About the JIP](/dual-track-curriculum/Integrated-Programme/overview/)**

**Rich and diverse student development and enrichment opportunities**&nbsp;are offered by CHS to&nbsp;both&nbsp;IP and SP track students as far as possible to complete our students’ education experience, e.g. Passion Pursuit (Elective) modules are offered to both IP and SP students.

The more significant differentiation is&nbsp;that&nbsp;**IP students have more time than SP students for learning news skills and knowledge or participating in experiential learning**, e.g. going on immersion trips in Year 4. OP students have to prepare and sit for the Singapore-Cambridge Secondary Education Certificate (SEC) examinations in Sec 4.

The following diagram provides an overview of our&nbsp;Dual Track curriculum, and highlights some of our signature programmes such as:

#### Shared Curriculum &amp; Programmes

In terms of curriculum, the two tracks of IP and SP share several features. Students from both tracks enjoy the same core curriculum for lower levels, &nbsp;**[CCAs](/non-academic/Physical-Education/overview/)**,&nbsp;**[student development](/student-development/Character-Education/overview/)**&nbsp;and well-being programmes,&nbsp;**student leadership**&nbsp;opportunities,&nbsp;**[Appreciation of Chinese Culture](/secondary/Distinctive-Programmes/sap-flagship-programme/)**&nbsp;lessons,&nbsp;[**overseas immersion and cultural trips**](/secondary/Distinctive-Programmes/overseas-immersion-and-cultural-experience/), and aesthetics and physical education. Most of our&nbsp;**[Talent Development Programmes](/secondary/Talent-Development/overview/)**&nbsp;(such as our CΩERGY Programme, MOE Music Elective Programme, Sports Talent Development Programme, etc.) are open to both IP and SP students. All IP and SP students are also offer our distinctive&nbsp;**[Passion Pursuit (Elective)](/secondary/distinctive-programmes/passion-pursuit/elective/)**&nbsp;programme to help them discover their passions and develop new skills beyond the classroom.&nbsp;SP students will also enjoy some components of the IP flagship&nbsp;World Readiness Programme.

#### IP-specific Curriculum &amp; Programmes

IP students will undertake a rigorous curriculum that have more extension of learning than SP. In addition, IP lessons will differ from SP&nbsp;in terms of&nbsp;**IP-specific pedagogy and assessments**. IP students will also offer additional subjects such as our&nbsp;**unique IP flagship**&nbsp;**[World Readiness Programme](/secondary/Distinctive-Programmes/world-readiness-programme/)**&nbsp;and&nbsp;**[Passion Pursuit (Independent)](/secondary/Distinctive-Programmes/passion-pursuit/independent/)**. In addition, IP students may participate in JIP Student Leadership Development programmes. Prospective students may want to take note that&nbsp;**[MOE Bicultural Studies Programme](/secondary/Talent-Development/bicultural-studies-programme/)**&nbsp;is offered to only IP students due to the students’ availability in Year 4 for overseas study trips and other programmes.
