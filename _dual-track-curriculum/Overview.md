### Dual Track O-Level Programme & Integrated Programme

To achieve the Desired Outcomes of a Catholic High School Education, **we offer the [Dual Track of Integrated Programme (also known as the Joint Integrated Programme) and O-Level Programme](https://staging.d26k7rl81eo6rb.amplifyapp.com/dual-track-curriculum/comparing-ip-and-op/)**. Both tracks will prepare students for the A-Level in Pre-University institutions, e.g. junior colleges. IP students will matriculate to the new [Eunoia Junior College](https://staging.d26k7rl81eo6rb.amplifyapp.com/dual-track-curriculum/Integrated-Programme/about-eunoia-jc/). OP students may also opt to articulate to a Polytechnic instead for Diploma courses. **Student joining CHS will choose their track during the DSA Exercise or the Sec 1 (S1) Posting Exercise.**

Whether it is the IP or O-Level curriculum, students in both programmes will enjoy opportunities to interact and learn together. For our top tier students who show a strong aptitude and passion for learning, CHS will provide them with our most challenging and rigorous talent development programmes.

The 6-year IP leverages the strengths of the three schools and provide the best of our students with a broad-based curriculum that is both rigorous and enriching beyond just academic content. The signature programmes of the JIP are the [Passion Pursuit (Independent)](https://staging.d26k7rl81eo6rb.amplifyapp.com/secondary/Distinctive-Programmes/passion-pursuit/independent/) and [World Readiness Programme](https://staging.d26k7rl81eo6rb.amplifyapp.com/secondary/Distinctive-Programmes/world-readiness-programme/).

The IP students from CHS, CHIJ SNGS and SCGS will spend their first four years in their respective secondary schools before progressing to Eunoia JC for two years of A-Level. IP students will proceed to [Eunoia JC](https://staging.d26k7rl81eo6rb.amplifyapp.com/dual-track-curriculum/Integrated-Programme/about-eunoia-jc/) without taking the O-Levels, so that they can use the time to engage in broader learning experiences.
