### Dual Track O-Level Programme &amp; Integrated Programme

To achieve the Desired Outcomes of a Catholic High School Education,&nbsp;**we offer the&nbsp;[Dual Track of Integrated Programme (also known as the Joint Integrated Programme) and O-Level Programme](/dual-track-curriculum/comparing-ip-and-op/)**. Both tracks will prepare students for the A-Level in Pre-University institutions, e.g. junior colleges. IP students will matriculate to the new&nbsp;Eunoia Junior College. OP students may also opt to articulate to a Polytechnic instead for Diploma courses.&nbsp;**Student joining CHS will choose their track during the DSA Exercise or the Sec 1 (S1) Posting Exercise.**

Whether it is the IP or O-Level curriculum, students in both programmes will enjoy opportunities to interact and learn together. For our top tier students who show a strong aptitude and passion for learning, CHS will provide them with our most challenging and rigorous talent development programmes.

The 6-year IP leverages the strengths of the three schools and provide the best of our students with a broad-based&nbsp;curriculum&nbsp;that is both rigorous and enriching beyond just academic content. The signature programmes of the JIP are the&nbsp;[Passion Pursuit (Independent)](/secondary/Distinctive-Programmes/passion-pursuit/independent/)&nbsp;and&nbsp;[World Readiness Programme](/secondary/Distinctive-Programmes/world-readiness-programme/).

The IP students from CHS, CHIJ SNGS and SCGS will spend their first four years in their respective secondary schools before progressing to Eunoia JC for two years of A-Level. IP students will proceed to&nbsp;Eunoia JC&nbsp;without taking the O-Levels, so that they can use the time to engage in broader learning experiences.

#### O-Level Programme

<img src="/images/dtp3.png" style="width:210px;height:240px;margin-right:15px;" align="left"> CHS continues to offer our established 4-year&nbsp;O-Level curriculum, which aims to provide a rigorous and enriched&nbsp;learning experience for our non-IP students so that they can excel at the GCE O-Level examinations. They are also offered our signature programmes such as our&nbsp;[Passion Pursuit (Elective)](/secondary/Distinctive-Programmes/passion-pursuit/elective/)&nbsp;to develop their character, 21CC, passions and skills beyond the classroom. OP students will apply to post-secondary learning institutions using their O-Level results.

Prospective students may want to take note that CHS OP students do not have affiliation&nbsp;bonus points when applying to EJC, but have affiliation bonus points when applying to Catholic Junior College. ([CJC is affiliated to Catholic schools](https://cjc.moe.edu.sg/))
