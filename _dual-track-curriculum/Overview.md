### Dual Track SEC Programme &amp; Integrated Programme

As a dual track school, we offer the [Joint Integrated Programme and SEC Programme](/dual-track-curriculum/comparing-ip-and-sp/). Both tracks will prepare students for the A-Level in Pre-University institutions, e.g. junior colleges. IP students will join [Eunoia Junior College](https://www.eunoiajc.moe.edu.sg/) at the end of four years. SP students may also opt to progress to a Polytechnic.&nbsp;**Students joining CHS will choose their track during the DSA Exercise or the Secondary 1  Posting Exercise.**

Regardless of the track students are in, students will enjoy opportunities to interact and learn together. Students who show a strong aptitude and passion for learning can look forward to talent development programmes that will stretch their potential.

The Joint Integrated Programme (JIP) leverages the strengths of the three schools and provides our students with a rigorous broad-based&nbsp;curriculum. The signature programmes of the JIP are the&nbsp;[Passion Pursuit (Independent)](/secondary/Distinctive-Programmes/passion-pursuit/independent/)&nbsp;and&nbsp;[World Readiness Programme](/secondary/Distinctive-Programmes/world-readiness-programme/).

IP students from CHS, CHIJ SNGS and SCGS will spend their first four years in their respective secondary schools before progressing to [Eunoia JC](https://www.eunoiajc.moe.edu.sg/).

#### SEC Programme

<img src="/images/dtp3.png" style="width:210px;height:240px;margin-right:15px;" align="left"> CHS has an established academic curriculum that provides a rigorous and enriched learning experience for our SEC programme students and many of them excel at the SEC examinations. They develop their character, passions and skills beyond the classroom through our signature programmes such&nbsp;[Passion Pursuit (Elective)](/secondary/Distinctive-Programmes/passion-pursuit/elective/). SP students will apply to post-secondary learning institutions using their SEC examination results.

Prospective students should note that CHS SP students do not have affiliation bonus points when applying to EJC, but have affiliation bonus points when applying to ([Catholic Junior College](https://cjc.moe.edu.sg/)).
