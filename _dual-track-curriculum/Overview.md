### Dual Track SEC Programme &amp; Integrated Programme

As a dual track school, we offer the [Joint Integrated Programme and SEC Programme](/dual-track-curriculum/comparing-ip-and-op/). Both tracks will prepare students for the A-Level in Pre-University institutions, e.g. junior colleges. IP students will join Eunoia Junior College at the end of four years. SP students may also opt to articulate to a Polytechnic instead for Diploma courses.&nbsp;**Students joining CHS will choose their track during the DSA Exercise or the Sec 1 (S1) Posting Exercise.**

Whether it is the IP or SEC curriculum, students in both programmes will enjoy opportunities to interact and learn together. For our top tier students who show a strong aptitude and passion for learning, CHS will provide them with our most challenging and rigorous talent development programmes.

The Joint Integrated Programme (JIP) leverages the strengths of the three schools and provides our students with a broad-based&nbsp;curriculum&nbsp;that is both rigorous and enriching. The signature programmes of the JIP are the&nbsp;[Passion Pursuit (Independent)](/secondary/Distinctive-Programmes/passion-pursuit/independent/)&nbsp;and&nbsp;[World Readiness Programme](/secondary/Distinctive-Programmes/world-readiness-programme/).

The IP students from CHS, CHIJ SNGS and SCGS will spend their first four years in their respective secondary schools before progressing to Eunoia JC for two years of A-Level.

#### SEC Programme

<img src="/images/dtp3.png" style="width:210px;height:240px;margin-right:15px;" align="left"> CHS has established curriculum that provides a rigorous and enriched&nbsp;learning experience for our non-IP students and many of them  excel at the SEC examinations. They are also offered our signature programmes such as our&nbsp;[Passion Pursuit (Elective)](/secondary/Distinctive-Programmes/passion-pursuit/elective/)&nbsp;to develop their character, 21CC, passions and skills beyond the classroom. SP students will apply to post-secondary learning institutions using their SEC examination results.

Prospective students may want to take note that CHS SP students do not have affiliation&nbsp;bonus points when applying to EJC, but have affiliation bonus points when applying to Catholic Junior College. ([CJC is affiliated to Catholic schools](https://cjc.moe.edu.sg/))
