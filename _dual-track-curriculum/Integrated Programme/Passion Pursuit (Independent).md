### Passion Pursuit (Independent)

Passion Pursuit (Independent) is one of two Joint Integrated Programme Flagship Programmes. It features authentic learning through research and mentorship, with the objective of equipping students with knowledge and inquiry skills from various disciplines to engage effectively in future problem solving. 

The objectives of Passion Pursuit (Independent) are to:
* Develop 21st Century Competencies and entrepreneurial dare in students;
* Help students discover passions by undertaking new challenges; and
* Develop new skills in students and guide them to acquire knowledge beyond the classroom


#### Our Approach

*   From Year 1 to 3, students engage in cross-disciplinary research projects with project themes designed to support students in discovering their interest and passion in different subject areas. 
*   Year 4 students embark on a Work Attachment Programme to apply and deepen soft skills in real working environments. They also go through an Entrepreneurship Programme to come up with their very first business plan.
