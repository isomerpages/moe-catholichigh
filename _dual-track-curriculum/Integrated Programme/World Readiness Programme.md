### World Readiness Programme

<img src="/images/wrp1.png" style="width:283px;height:360px;margin-right:15px;" align="left"> **World Readiness Programme (WRP)** aims to develop our students’ ability to impact lives in positive, ethical and meaningful ways. The WRP supports students’ understanding of Singapore’s place in the world. There is exposure to both Eastern and Western perspectives on issues and trends ranging from the geopolitical, social, cultural, economic to technological.

#### Curriculum
From Years 1 to 4, modules offered under Philosophy of Knowledge and Emerging Asia ride on the existing strengths of our schools in nurturing bilingual and bicultural students. They also develop our JIP students to be well-versed in eastern and western perspectives on knowledge, reason and values. The Current Affairs modules are designed to promote an understanding of global issues and megatrends.

The WRP utilises a variety of learning platforms to engage students. In addition to seminars and lessons in each school, schools also engage or participate in programmes organized by external agencies (e.g. participation in Model United Nations Conferences).  The three partner secondary schools also collaboratively organise annual WRP Symposiums where students are brought together to benefit from the synergistic sharing of ideas and perspectives.  At these WRP Symposiums, our students interact with people across a broad spectrum of society, including research engineers, foreign diplomats, social entrepreneurs and thought leaders.
