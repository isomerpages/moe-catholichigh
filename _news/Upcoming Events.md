#### Family Day & Homecoming 2019 “双轨火车Celebrating Our Bicultural Identity”

Date and Time: **6th July 2019, 8:30 AM – 3:00 PM**

We would like to extend our warmest invitation to all old boys, students’ families, school partners and community members to our annual Family Day & Homecoming. We come together as one big family to mingle, deepen friendships and support our students who will showcase their entrepreneurial spirit through the setting up of games, merchandise and food stalls.

The Family Day & Homecoming event is a fun-filled and meaningful event where we aim to foster school spirit and strengthen the value of gratitude (饮水思源) in our students. Through the sale of carnival coupons, the funds raised from our students’ efforts are used to support a wide range of students’ programmes.

Save the date and join us on the 6th of July! You can buy carnival coupons on the day or earlier from any CHS staff/students at $10/coupon sheet.
