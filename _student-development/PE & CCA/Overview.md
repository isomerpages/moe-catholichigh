### Developing Resilient and Rugged Leaders


The&nbsp;**Physical Education &amp; Co-curricular Activities**&nbsp;in CHS aims to deliver a thinking and differentiated curriculum with innovative student-centric and values-driven programmes that promote psychomotor, cognitive and affective development of Catholic High Gentlemen. The end in mind is to develop holistic health amongst students through promotion of a healthy lifestyle in Physical Education and Co-curricular Activities, and groom 21st century CHS leaders with a robust character and a passion to serve.

##### Co-curricular Activities

The CCA Programme in Catholic High School provides students with a platform to discover their interests and talents. Students progressively develop CCA-specific knowledge, skills, values and attitudes through sustained participation. CCA also offer excellent platforms for students to learn core values, social and emotional competencies and the emerging 21st Century Competencies. All CCA emphasise social interaction by providing a common space for friendships and social integration amongst students of diverse backgrounds. Through CCA, students develop a sense of identity and belonging to the school. Schools enable all students to have active and meaningful CCA participation when they provide a balanced, inclusive and diverse CCA programme which caters to a broad spectrum of interests and talents.

#### Physical Education

The PE programme in Catholic High School aims to enable our students to demonstrate individually and with others the physical skills, practices, and values to enjoy a lifetime of active, healthy living. Our students participate in a variety of physical activities to acquire a range of motor skills, understand and apply movement concepts, principles and strategies. They also demonstrate safe practices during physical and daily activities with respect to themselves, others and the environment. They display positive personal and social behaviour across different experiences, acquire and maintain health-enhancing fitness through regular participation in physical activities to enjoy and value the benefits of living a physically active and healthy life.
