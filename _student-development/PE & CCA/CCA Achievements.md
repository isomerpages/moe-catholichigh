### Leaving a&nbsp;Legacy

Catholic High School offers a wide range of Co-curricular Activities to provide our students in IP and SP with a platform to discover their interests and talents. Through the guidance by our expert CCA Instructors and dedicated teachers-in-charge, and with the support of parents and alumni, our students have maximised their potential and achieved much in all the areas of CCA.

#### 2025 CCA Physical Sports Results

Our sportsmen have done us proud with numerous ‘B’ and ‘C’ Division National School Games – National and Zone achievements, bettering their personal best, gaining top positions and most importantly, for many of them, prevailing against all odds with an unyielding individual focus and a strong team spirit. Our heartiest congratulations to our sportsmen for being faster, higher, and stronger, as they fought and soared through the preliminaries to the play-offs, to the semis and finally to the finals! Beyond the medals and positions, we would like to commend our boys for demonstrating the spirit of “Discipline, Character, Championship” in their sporting endeavours.

#### 2025 Performing Arts Achievements
It has been a great experience for all six of our Performing Arts Groups, Chinese Drama, Chinese Orchestra, Edward Becheras Choir, English Drama, Modern Dance, and Symphony Band, who performed at the SYF Arts Presentations. Their outstanding performances moved both the adjudicators as well as the audience. Their hours of practice to hone their skills, techniques and processes has enabled them to put into practice and showcase their art form at the highest quality. We are proud of every single CHS performer who exudes confidence on and off the stage!

#### 2024 Uniformed Groups Achievements
Catholic High’s Uniformed Groups belong to one of the greatest traditions of the school, with the focus on leadership development and robust characteristics. This year, we are very proud to celebrate, once again, the highest UG awards attained by all the five Uniformed Groups and their Cadets, testifying to their resilience, camaraderie and leadership.
