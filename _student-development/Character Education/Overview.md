### Moulding Our Gentlemen’s Character, One Day at a Time

<img src="/images/sd6.png" style="width:40%">

Our **Character & Citizenship Education (CCE) curriculum** is grounded in our school vision – _Leaders, Gentlemen and Bilingual Scholars, with High Integrity and Robust Character, who are Passionate about Life, Learning and Service to Others_. The curriculum provides multiple platforms and opportunities for our students to realise their potential alongside their academic learning.

At Catholic High, **every teacher is a CCE teacher**, and the teaching of values and citizenry is infused into the school curriculum.

*   Every morning assembly begins with a prayer to prepare our students’ minds for the day’s learning, and our Principal starts each week with a personal sharing on values.
*   During our **Morning Breakfast Session**, students can discuss ideas and concerns with their Form Teachers in a small-group setting.
*   In **CCE lessons**, students will learn about values such as love, respect and resilience. They also get to explore different leadership styles, and discuss issues concerning Singapore and the world.
*   Out of the classrooms, students can connect what they have learned with hands-on **Values-in-Action (VIA) projects**, apply leadership skills on various platforms including CCAs, and share their learning experiences through **Personalised Mentoring** with the teachers.
*   In addition, the **thematic commemoration** of Total Defence Day, International Friendship Day, Racial Harmony Day and National Day complements the CCE curriculum for deep discussions on our country.
*   Through [Citizenship Education](https://staging.d26k7rl81eo6rb.amplifyapp.com/student-development/Character-Education/citizenship-education/) **Learning Journeys**, students will learn about our Nation’s Past, Present and Charted Future, and how they can play a part in **making the Present better and in transforming our Future**.

Moulding our students’ character requires a **multi-faceted approach**. In addition to CCE lessons and VIA projects, our students also take part in our **‘Gentleman in the Making’ Programme,** where they will:

*   Attend workshops such as **Values Workshop** for Level 1 students, and
*   **Social and Etiquette Workshops** and **Lifeskills Workshops** for Levels 2 to 4 students.

Through these workshops, our students will learn about values of filial piety and gentlemanly behaviour in different social settings.

There are also several [**pinnacle programmes and platforms**](https://catholichigh.moe.edu.sg/student-development/pe-and-cca/overview/), such as the **Student Leadership Boards** and **CCA leadership**, for developing our students who display aptitudes, attitudes, and passion to serve others for the better good of the class, school, community and society.
