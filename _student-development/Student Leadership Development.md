### Developing Principled Leaders

In CHS, our leadership development programme “领” is offered to students who have demonstrated potential in taking up school-wide leadership roles and with a heart to serve. The concept of ‘Leader’ is integral to the Catholic High experience, and it is rooted in our strong heritage of nurturing generations of leaders for the nation in numerous fields – public service, academia, culture, business and many more.

Through the curricular, co-curricular and community experiences and signature programmes, Catholic High students are developed to become leaders who are visionary, grounded upon strong moral principles, and who lead with empathy and by example: to inspire, to serve and to leave a collective legacy. Whatever the pathways and opportunities, we take a stand on developing Principled Leaders who can touch lives and transform the futures of himself and others. At CHS, our student leaders “Represent, Role Model and Re-Imagine”.

#### Pathways &amp; Opportunities

Catholic High’s student leadership framework draws reference from the school vision and the student leadership vision in developing our student leaders. Student leaders are guided by their beliefs in service to the school and community and that leadership is a responsibility to serve others. In order to achieve the desired outcomes of student leaders, our gentlemen are given opportunities to train and develop key competencies which cover a range of critical thinking, communication skills and dispositions so that they are able to contribute at different levels.

We believe that to lead is to make a difference and to be the difference, and this is the guiding philosophy that steers our student leaders as they helm our various students’ organisations such as the Students’ Council, the Prefectorial Board, the Class Management Committee and in their roles as CCA leaders and the various Ambassador roles at subject and programme levels.

The pathways and opportunities for leadership development are varied and dependent on each student’s interest and ability.

*   These students went on to excel in both academic and non-academic spheres and were recognised through the Lee Kuan Yew Award for All-Round Excellence (LKYARE) for Secondary Schools.&nbsp;Our 2017 winner, Benjamin Soh was a Staff Sergeant in NPCC, our Head Prefect as well as an Assistant Chief Editor for our school’s Chinese student newsletter.&nbsp;Siauw Yu Chuan, winner of 2019 LKYARE was our Scouts Troop Leader and a Prefect serving the school. One of our Class Chairmen, Damien Kang, also a Scouts Troop Leader won the LKYARE in 2020.

“In my years in Catholic High School, I met many different leaders, and witnessed and experienced many forms of leadership. Being exposed to a multitude of activities, in Prefectorial Board, National Police Cadet Corps and 燎原报 (Chinese Newsletter), offered me the opportunities to learn and practise different forms of leadership, equipping me with critical thinking and evaluative skills, and allowing me to hone my bilingual competency. Most importantly, igniting in me the passion to serve not only the school but also the community.”

Students who are keen to volunteer their services at the school-wide level can also apply to our Student Leadership Board (SLB) as probates to be developed and qualify as Prefects, Student Councillors or Class Management Committee leaders. They can also indicate their interest to their respective teachers-in-charge should they wish to pursue a leadership position within their CCAs.

#### Development Programmes

Basic leadership is also covered through our CCE programme and covers leadership theories and good leadership practises, so that all gentlemen can grow and develop a better appreciation of their aspirations, strengths and areas for growth. For students who are serving in the leadership boards or serving as ambassadors, they will undergo a more comprehensive leadership training that comprises workshops on communication skills, project management, leadership case studies and scenario planning, as well as having the opportunities to participate in intra-school and beyond-school student forums, leadership conferences and community advocacy projects.

IP students also experience Joint IP Student Leadership Development with students from CHIJ St Nicholas Girls’ School and Singapore Chinese Girls’ School.
