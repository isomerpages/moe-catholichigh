### Developing Resilient and Rugged Leaders

The Physical Education &amp; Co-curricular Activities in CHS aims to deliver a thinking and differentiated curriculum with innovative student-centric and values-driven programmes that promote psychomotor, cognitive and affective development. The end in mind is to develop holistic health amongst students through promotion of a healthy lifestyle in Physical Education and Co-curricular Activities, and groom 21st century CHS leaders with a robust character and a passion to serve.

##### Co-curricular Activities

Catholic High School offers a range of Co-curricular Activities to provide our students in SP and IP with a platform to discover their interests and talents. Through the CCAs, our students are guided to live a balanced education experience that cultivates and develops friendship, resilience, lifeskills, leadership qualities and other competencies. This helps our students to lead a balanced life in adulthood. In turn, our students have also&nbsp;[accomplished a great deal in national competitions](/secondary/awards-and-achievements/cca-achievements/), performances and other opportunities.
