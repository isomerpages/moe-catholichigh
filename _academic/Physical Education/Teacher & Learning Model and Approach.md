CHS PE curriculum is strongly guided by the core and school values that form the foundation for exploration, acquisition and application of games skills and concepts. With proper planning and the execution of appropriately structured physical activities during physical education lessons, the pupils will be placed in game situations so as to raise their awareness of the need to practise and apply the core and school values. Rather than wait for the “teachable moments” to arise so that pupils will be able to apply the values explicitly, the PE department believes to create deliberate moments through setting of conditions and modification of game rules so that the pupils can be imbued with the values through experiential learning.

The mastery of fundamental motor skills and movement concepts is of utmost importance especially to the lower primary pupils as this will form the bedrock for the upper primary pupils in the areas of games concepts through systematic and progressive extension of skills.

In line with the school vision, that is, the Catholic High student is a leader, gentleman and bilingual scholar of high integrity and robust character, who is passionate about life, learning and service to others. The PE department has devised an Outdoor Education curriculum which is closely guided by the MOE syllabus for all the levels Physical Education lessons. The outdoor education module encompasses orienteering, basic knotting skills, tent pitching, residential camp and rock climbing lessons.

Lastly, with close monitoring and detailed review processes, the departments works towards implementing programmes that will develop every Catholic High pupil holistically.
