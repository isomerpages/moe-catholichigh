We, the Mathematics Department, believe in nurturing the child to be an effective problem solver through innovative and interesting programmes to engage their minds.

### Experiential Mathematics Learning

Mathematics is a science of pattern and order (National Research Council, 1989, Pg 60). Through the use of manipulative, pupils learn the skill of observing, extending patterns and forming relationships between existing and new found information. Finding and using patterns is an essential strategy for living, in mathematical thinking and in problem solving.
