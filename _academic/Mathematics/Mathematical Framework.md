### Mathematical Framework

The Mathematical Framework articulates the underlying principles for an effective mathematics programme. Within the framework, mathematical problem solving is at the heart of mathematics learning, and it involves the application of mathematical concepts and skills, the development of process skills such as reasoning and communicating, raising meta-cognition in problem solving, and nurturing a positive attitude towards learning mathematics (summarised by the five inter-related components of concepts, skills, processes, attitudes and metacognition).
