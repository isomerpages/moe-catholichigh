</style>

A vibrant Mathematics learning environment that instills confidence in problem solving and promotes creative and critical thinking.

### Our Mission

To equip each child with the problem solving skills through innovative and interesting programmes to engage their minds as well as relate Math to real-life situations.

### Our Philosophy

We, the Mathematics Department, believe in nurturing the child to be an effective problem solver through innovative and interesting programmes to engage their minds.

##### Experiential Mathematics Learning

Mathematics is a science of pattern and order (National Research Council, 1989, Pg 60). Through the use of manipulative, pupils learn the skill of observing, extending patterns and forming relationships between existing and new found information. Finding and using patterns is an essential strategy for living, in mathematical thinking and in problem solving.

##### Mathalympics

Mathalympics is a Mathematics competition held for the Primary 1 to 3 pupils in Semester 2 to cultivate pupils’ love for logical reasoning in mathematics. The game called “Connect4” challenges pupils to form a row of the same colour while his opponents must prevent this from happening by blocking it with another colour.

##### Mastermind

The Mathematics competition for Primary 4 to 6 pupils is entitled ‘MASTERMIND’. Mastermind is a classic code-breaking board game of logic and deduction involving a code maker and a code maker.

The idea of the game is for one player (the code-breaker) to guess the secret code chosen by the other player (the code-maker). The code-breaker makes a series of pattern guesses – after each guess the code-maker gives feedback, the number of pegs that are of the right color and in the correct position, and the number of pegs that are of the correct color but not in the correct position – these numbers are usually represented by small black and white pegs.

##### Math Olympiad Trainings and Competitions

The objective is to extend pupils’ analytical skills in Mathematics and is targeted at high ability pupils who have a special aptitude in Mathematics. Selected Primary 4, 5 and 6 pupils undergo external training and represent school in various Math Olympiad Competitions organised by different schools in Singapore.

##### E2K (Excellence 2000)

E2K is a programme that caters to selected Primary 4 to P6 pupils with an interest in and aptitude for Mathematics. It aims to develop students' mathematical reasoning skills and deepens their conceptual understanding through an inquiry approach. Pupils work independently or collaborate with their peers and engage in mathematical thinking through resources such as puzzles, games and mathematical explorations specially designed for this programme.
