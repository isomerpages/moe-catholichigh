*   equip our boys with basic scientific knowledge, concepts and principles and learn about scientific applications in daily life
*   provide our boys with opportunities to develop skills and attitudes necessary for scientific inquiry
*   provide our boys with experiences which build on their interest in and stimulate their curiosity about the environment
*   help our boys appreciate how science influences people and the environment
