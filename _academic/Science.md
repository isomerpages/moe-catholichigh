### Department Vision: 
To nurture self-directed learners with critical and inquiring minds with a passion for exploring Science 

### Department Mission:
A vibrant and innovative Science Department which equips pupils with relevant skills for scientific inquiry and a mindset for excellence
  
### Department Philosophy:
We believe our pupils are passionate about learning Science and are able to apply scientific knowledge in their daily lives. Being independent learners and critical thinkers, they are empowered to influence and contribute positively and ethically to the community and environment.

### I<sup>2</sup>E Approach <br>(Inspire, Inquire, Enrich):

##### Inspire:
Pupils enjoy learning Science and are fascinated by how everyday phenomena have scientific connections and how Science and Technology have transformed and improved our lives. 

##### Inquire:
Pupils possess the spirit of scientific inquiry. They are grounded in the knowledge and can think critically.

##### Enrich:
Various experiential learning will further promote the learning of Science in a fun and engaging way. Pupils apply scientific knowledge in their daily lives.

## Teaching and Learning Approaches

The school adopts an inquiry-based approach in the teaching and learning of Science. Varied teaching strategies provide our young learners the opportunities to develop concepts, skills and attitudes for scientific inquiry through experiential learning and to engage them to make learning fun and meaningful. 
  
The curriculum provides pupils a broad understanding of the natural world. To help the boys understand Science in the context of the living environment, the teaching and learning of Science is not just confined within the classrooms but rather learning beyond classrooms. The outdoors become the living classroom where learning is authentic and relevant. The experiential learning and enrichment lessons arouse pupils’ curiosity and interest in Science. 
  
The use of Information Communication Technology (ICT) also complements the teaching and learning. Tools such as iPAD for garden trail and dataloggers to conduct investigations better engage the boys and also build their 21st century competencies. The Student Learning Space (SLS), an online learning portal, provides our teachers with a range of tools to customise and create meaningful learning experiences with technology. The SLS is used to encourage our pupils to be self-directed, and promotes collaborative learning.
