#### GEP Department (GEP) in CHS

The Gifted Education Programme (GEP) in Catholic High School was established in 1998. The programme aims to provide our pupils with an accelerated and enriched academic programme in an environment steeped in the traditions of bilingualism. We also strive to provide an educational experience conducive for the moral and character development of our pupils.

Catholic High School received its first batch of 33 GEP boys in January of 1998 under the care of 5 teachers. Since those early days, the programme has grown to its present size of 116 pupils in the three levels (P4-P6), and a teaching staff of 16.

#### DEPARTMENT VISION

The Catholic High GEP gentleman is a morally upright and effectively bilingual individual, who constantly strives for continuous improvement as a servant leader and critical thinker.

#### DEPARTMENT MISSION

The Gifted Education department in Catholic High School strives to provide a holistic educational experience that prepares our Catholic High Gentlemen for success in both academic and affective domains. We are committed to fostering morally upright and effective bilingual individuals, who are dedicated to continuous self-improvement as servant leaders and critical thinkers.

#### DEPARTMENT PHILOSOPHY

As educators of young gentlemen, we passionately believe in harnessing positive education to cultivate intrinsically motivated individuals with life-long learning habits. We endeavour to inculcate values and impart knowledge through the enriched curriculum to develop our pupils, equip them with the necessary skill-set to navigate the changing landscape of the future and to become responsible leaders who have a strong social conscience and commitment to serve others.
