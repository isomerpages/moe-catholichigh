### CHS Character Development Programme

#### 7 Habits of Happy Kids

In Catholic High School (Primary), we believe in nurturing our pupils holistically. Hence, we focused on developing our gentlemen through the 7 Habits of Kids by Sean Covey through our CCE lessons, FTGP lessons and daily interactions in class.

1\.  Be Proactive <Br>
2.  Begin with the End in Mind<Br>
3.  Put First Things First <br>
4.  Think Win Win<br>
5.  Seek First to Understand, Then to Be Understood <br>
6.  Synergize<br>
7.  Sharpen the Saw

The pupils were taught explicitly and given opportunities to practice and reflect on the habits through their daily tasks, activities and school events.

#### Learning Beyond the Classroom

At CHS, outdoor education also plays an important role for our GEP pupils. We believe that learning is not just confined to the four walls of the classroom; experiential learning goes beyond that so as to contextualise pupilsâ€™ learning back in school and to broaden their horizons. Here are some Learning Journeys that our pupils have been to.
