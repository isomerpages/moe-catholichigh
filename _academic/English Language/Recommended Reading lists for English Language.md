Dear Parents,

The suggested reading lists attached have been categorized into lower, middle and upper primary for our gentlemen. The titles chosen are likely to be of interest to boys of the respective age groups.

They are intended to be a handy resource to help you and your child select good books to read for leisure.

We have attempted to suggest titles with a wide variety of themes. Many of these books happen to be award winners e. g. Caldecott Medal, Newbery Medal winners, or Librariansâ€™ Choice titles.

We hope our young gentlemen have fun as they immerse themselves in the magical world of books.

Happy Reading!
