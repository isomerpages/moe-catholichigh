<p>Dear Parents,</p>
<p>The recommended reading lists attached have been organised into lower,
middle and upper primary categories and are tailored for our young gentlemen.
These titles have been specifically chosen to capture the interest of boys
within their respective age groups.</p>
<p>Designed as a handy resource, these lists aim to help you and your child
select good books to read for leisure. The suggested titles cover a diverse
range of themes. Many of them boast prestigious accolades such as the Caldecott
Medal, Newbery Medal or recognition as Librarians' Choice titles.</p>
<p>We hope that our young gentlemen will derive joy as they immerse themselves
into the enchanting world of books.</p>
<p>Happy Reading!</p>
