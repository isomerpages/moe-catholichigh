### Student Outcomes

**“_… one thing which has not changed is Catholic High School’s emphasis on values and character development. That is something timeless and essential, and in fact, something which we want all Singapore schools to do more of, because our students should not just be book-smart, but should grow up to be citizens of good character, who will contribute to society and serve fellow Singaporeans._”**

_Prime Minister Mr Lee_&nbsp;_Hsien_&nbsp;_Loong,_&nbsp;_Catholic High School Alumni_

We prepare our students – like the sturdy, yet flexible and highly adaptable bamboo – to thrive in a volatile, uncertain, complex and&nbsp;ambiguous&nbsp;world. We challenge our students&nbsp;to look beyond the local to the global,&nbsp;beyond problems to opportunities,&nbsp;beyond risks to possibilities,&nbsp;and beyond the functional and utilitarian to the emotive and cultural.&nbsp;In doing so, we nurture students who have the wisdom, the boldness and the drive to create and transform the future they desire.
