### 弦歌讽诵八十年


#### From a Small Seed a Mighty Tree Shall Grow


**十年树木，百年树人，公教中学屹立新加坡八十年，为社会各领域培养了不少中坚人才。公教校训是“亲爱忠诚”，中学加上“敬业乐群”的惕励。在专业或工商范畴作出卓越贡献，这是历届校友孜孜以求的人生目标。**

**If you are planning for a year, sow rice.** **If you are planning for a decade, plant trees.** **If you are planning for a lifetime, educate people.**

The Catholic High School experience is one that is not merely academic. We believe in producing intelligent, inquisitive and independent minds. We believe in well-roundedness, and a balanced education that comprises academia, passions and moral values. We ingrain in our students the desire to be the best that they can be, and equip them with the tools to excel in life.

Some 80 batches of students have passed through our school’s gateway. At Catholic High, we also provide a caring environment for our students. It is this culture that instils in our students and old boys a genuine sense of civic-mindedness and the desire to provide service to others. As such, we have nurtured a crop of leaders and professionals in various fields – the crème de la crème who give back to society and our school the way Catholic High strives to provide for their students. They have gone on to breathe meaning into this in their respective lives and careers upon graduation, pioneers and leaders with the mission to contribute to the disciplines and to society.

#### Our Strong Network of Illustrious Alumni

With more than 80 years of heritage of excellence, CHS has a strong network of illustrious alumni who give back to society and our school.

Many of CHS’ alumni are prominent public figures serving the international, public, community or business sectors. They continue to contribute to our school and support the learning of our student and school events. The following video shows our alumni and Singapore’s Prime Minster, Mr Lee Hsien Loong, speaking at our 80th Anniversary Founder’s Day Dinner in 2015:

“… one thing which has not changed is Catholic High School’s emphasis on values and character development. That is something timeless and essential, and in fact, something which we want all Singapore schools to do more of, because our students should not just be book-smart, but should grow up to be citizens of good character, who will contribute to society and serve fellow Singaporeans…

It is because Catholic High School has upheld these values, that over the last 80 years it has produced many leaders in different fields of society, not just in politics, but in business, in education, in culture.”
