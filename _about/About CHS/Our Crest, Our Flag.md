##### Catholic High School – School Crest

<img src="/images/about6.png">

Blue Colour symbolizes the infinite and boundless universe in which Man is free to think and choose how best to spend his time to develop his character as an individual who does not wall man off from his community, and simultaneously does not suffocate his own individuality. His own entity in humanity is a lesson of good faith guided by trust in God.

蓝色象征宇宙的无限，暗喻每人都能自由地选择如何利用他的时间来修养自己的品德。人人都有自己的独特性，既不拒人于千里之外，又能同时保有自己的人格，这种博爱仁慈的美德，乃受自于天主的信仰与信赖。

The Cross represents Jesus Christ who suffered and died for the salvation of all mankind. It is a reminder that we must shoulder our responsibilities to society and to ourselves patiently. To this end, we shall reap the fruits of the labour of love such as peace, joy, forbearance, temperance and brotherly kindness.

十字架代表为拯救世人而受刑至死的耶稣基督。十字架提醒我们应该耐心地对社会及自身负起责任。这样，我们才能分享亲爱忠诚的成果。这包括和平、欢欣、忍耐、节约及兄友弟恭的祥和。

The Light signifies that Jesus Christ is the light of the universe. The light of Christ shines far and wide so that we may behold His manifestations. It also illuminates for us the correct and righteous path so that we may walk boldly and wisely if we trust and love Him.

曙光代表耶稣基督是世界之光。圣光照耀四海，故我们能看见天主光辉的形象。只要我们信仰天主，我们必能勇敢而自信的迈向光明的正道。

The white colour symbolizes purity, integrity and flawlessness of character; the yellow colour represents the vastness of the Pontiff that reaches out and the Church that promulgates; the cross in the school crest represents Jesus Christ who suffered and died for the salvation of mankind.

白色象征纯洁，亦即品格之纯粹洁净不污染与无暇；黄色代表教宗与教会所遍及的广阔无边的博大；校徽中的十字架代表济世救人的真主耶稣。
