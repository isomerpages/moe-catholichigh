### Our Values, Our Purpose


Our humble beginning, as a school in a hut on the premises of the Church of St Peter and Paul at Queen Street, continues to drive our beliefs and aspirations to provide quality education for all, Catholics and non-Catholics alike. The ethos of our far-sighted and global-minded Founder, Rev. Fr. Edward Becheras, continues to guide our education philosophy in championing bilingual experiences for our students.

*   As a Catholic mission school, **love is the motivation behind all our actions**. We ensure there is **Joy of Learning** in school life, and that our students develop a **Mindset** **of Excellence**.
*   Our school’s core values underpin every member’s attitude, actions and aspirations. These School Values of **_Love_**_,_ **_Creativity_**_,_ **_Constancy of Purpose_** and **_Continuous Improvement_** permeate our curriculum and are exemplified in school processes, our teachers’ work and stakeholders’ support. These factors have forged a strong tradition of excellence in all-round development of students, an outstanding legacy of producing visionary leaders and a strong network of alumni members from different fields who are dedicated, and supportive of our school.
*   Guided by our Motto, Values and Vision, **we aspire to touch the lives of every student who comes through our institution, and in turn, transform their futures and through them, the futures of others**
