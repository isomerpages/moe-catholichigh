### Our Values, Our Purpose


Our humble beginning, as a school in a hut on the premises of the Church of St Peter and Paul at Queen Street, continues to drive our beliefs and aspirations to provide quality education for all, Catholics and non-Catholics alike. The ethos of our far-sighted and global-minded Founder, Rev. Fr. Edward Becheras, continues to guide our education philosophy in championing bilingual experiences for our students.
