*Guided by the firm belief that the joy of learning is integral to supporting future learning and igniting a zest for life, our Passion Pursuit (PP) programme offers customised opportunities for JIP students to pursue their learning at an extended or deeper level in both the academic and non-academic domains during their six-year journey with the JIP.*

<font style="color:#1e395f">Passion Pursuit</font> provides avenues for intellectual discovery, leadership excellence and extra-curricular exploration essential to lifelong learning, through an enriching journey of Diverge, Converge and Emerge. Students get to explore a broad spectrum of interest areas under the Diverge phase, understand what passion really means through the Converge phase and eventually actualise it as part of purposeful living in the Emerge phase. Our flagship programme will inspire our students to not simply discover their passions, but aspire to use that to positively impact others for the betterment of society.

<font style="color:#1e395f">Passion Pursuit</font> is implemented through Platforms for Exploration and Platforms for Pursuit, and is further enriched by the strong partnership among the JIP schools and our networks of alumni and community partners.
