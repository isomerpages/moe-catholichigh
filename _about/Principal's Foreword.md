### Principal's Foreword

<img src="/images/principal.png" style="width:223px;height:240px;margin-right:15px;" align = "left"> Catholic High School is an educational institution of excellence rooted in over 80 years of rich heritage. Founded in 1935 by Father Edward Becheras, Catholic High School has grown from its humble beginnings at a small shack in Queen Street to a school distinguished by its diverse educational offering catering to boys aged 6 to 16. As an Autonomous School offering both the Integrated Programme and the O-Level Programme, our enriched curriculum broadens and deepens our gentlemen’s intellectual pursuits and 21st century competencies in the context of a fast-changing global world. As a Special Assistance Plan School offering the MOE Bicultural Studies Programme, we are committed to developing effectively bilingual and bicultural scholars with a passion for the language and understanding of the culture. We also offer the MOE Music Elective Programme and school based talent development programmes for English, Humanities, Mathematics and Sciences to give our gentlemen ample opportunities to develop their interests and strengths. Beyond academic endeavours, our gentlemen further develop their passion and leadership qualities through a wide range of enrichment programmes and CCAs.

Being a Catholic mission school, the value of love undergirds all that we do at Catholic High School. The culture of care in a God-centred environment is forged by nurturing teachers who go the extra mile to shape the character of our gentlemen and guide them in their learning. Every year, our outstanding and innovative teachers receive accolades from the teaching fraternity, parents and students in recognition of their high level of competency and care. We are also blessed with unstinting support from our alumni and parents who rally around our common mission of providing the best education to all Catholic High Gentlemen.

The Catholic High Spirit is an invigorating one that transcends generations. This is a school that heeds the call of the school anthem wherever we are. This is a school characterised by a common bond of brotherhood that stands by values and principles. This is a school where our blood is green. Catholic High School has nurtured countless boys from various backgrounds into key contributors in all sectors of our society – from politics to civil society, public service to private enterprise, sciences to the arts, and from Singapore to ASEAN to the world at large. We welcome you to our home of leaders, gentlemen and bilingual scholars as we continue to forge extraordinary pathways in touching lives and transforming futures.
