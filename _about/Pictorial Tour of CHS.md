*   As a full-school, we have a wide range of facilities to support our students’ learning and growth.
*   We have a full-size 400-metre six-lane running track, a Clock Tower with chapel, an Outdoor Adventure Learning Centre, and two sets of most facilities (e.g. 2 Multi-purpose Halls, 2 Indoor Sports Halls and even 2 canteens to support the primary and secondary sections). These facilities are shared by the sections, giving us the flexibility and space to offer a greater spread of opportunities for our students.
*   We are constantly improving and optimising the physical environment to support teaching and learning. For instance, since 2018, we have added a digital music studio to support our Music Elective Programme, the Science, Technology and Research Space lab to support the school’s distinctive programme in Space and Flight Science, a broadcasting studio to promote a bicultural environment as well as the student-designed Bunker to advocate student voice and agency.
