### Joint Integrated Programme (JIP)


**Our IP is a joint programme offered together with [Singapore Chinese Girls’ School (SCGS)](https://scgs.moe.edu.sg/) and [CHIJ St. Nicholas Girls’ School (CHIJ SNGS)](http://chijstnicholasgirls.moe.edu.sg/secondary).** The 6-year IP leverages the strengths of the three schools and provide the best of our students with a broad-based curriculum that is both rigorous and enriching beyond just academic content. The signature programmes of the JIP are the [Passion Pursuit (Independent)](https://staging.d26k7rl81eo6rb.amplifyapp.com/secondary/Distinctive-Programmes/passion-pursuit/) and [World Readiness Programme](https://staging.d26k7rl81eo6rb.amplifyapp.com/secondary/Distinctive-Programmes/world-readiness-programme/).

The IP students from CHS, CHIJ SNGS and SCGS will spend their first four years in their respective secondary schools before progressing to [Eunoia JC](http://eunoiajc.moe.edu.sg/) for two years of A-Level. IP students will proceed to Eunoia JC without taking the O-Levels, so that they can use the time to engage in broader learning experiences.
