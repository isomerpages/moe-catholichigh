### Leaving a Legacy

Every year, we encourage our students to participate, compete and excel in various activities at the national schools and international level and within our secondary and primary levels. Through these activities, they forge their own legacy of excellence and continue to embody the Catholic High School values of Love, Creativity, Constancy of Purpose and Continuous Improvement. Our students continue to excel and achieve high standards and outcomes in competitions and various platforms, leaving a legacy of excellence for themselves and the school.
