### CHS Character Development Programme

#### 7 Habits of Happy Kids

In Catholic High School (Primary), we believe in nurturing our pupils holistically. Hence, we focused on developing our gentlemen through the 7 Habits of Kids by Sean Covey through our CCE lessons, FTGP lessons and daily interactions in class.

1\.  Be Proactive <Br>
2.  Begin with the End in Mind<Br>
3.  Put First Things First <br>
4.  Think Win Win<br>
5.  Seek First to Understand, Then to Be Understood <br>
6.  Synergize<br>
7.  Sharpen the Saw

The pupils were taught explicitly and given opportunities to practice and reflect on the habits through their daily tasks, activities and school events.

#### Learning Beyond the Classroom

At CHS, outdoor education also plays an important role for our GEP pupils. We believe that learning is not just confined to the four walls of the classroom; experiential learning goes beyond that so as to contextualise pupils’ learning back in school and to broaden their horizons. Here are some Learning Journeys that our pupils have been to.

#### The eHCL Programme @ CHS

This 3-year enriched Higher Chinese (eHCL) Programme runs from Primary 4 to Primary 6 and is based on MOE’s Higher Chinese curriculum which incorporates greater emphasis on higher order thinking. It is designed to stretch and deepen pupils’ proficiency in Higher Chinese. Lessons will be enriched with differentiated learning experiences to engage our pupils. These activities include designing language games, exploring language use through different forms of media and participating in the Reading Carnival organised by the Gifted Education Branch.

The eHCL Programme is conducted during curriculum time, together with pupils in the Gifted Education Programme. This allows for more diverse interactions and engaging discussions for all our pupils. The class size for this programme is about 30 pupils and movement between teaching venues is to be expected. Pupils in the eHCL programme continue to sit for the same set of school-based assessment as their Primary 4 peers who are taking Higher Chinese.

Here are some examples of the learning experiences for pupils in the eHCL programme:
