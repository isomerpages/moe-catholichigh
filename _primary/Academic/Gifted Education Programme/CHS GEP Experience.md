#### GEP Department (GEP) in CHS

The Gifted Education Programme (GEP) in Catholic High School was established in 1998. The programme aims to provide our pupils with an accelerated and enriched academic programme in an environment steeped in the traditions of bilingualism. We also strive to provide an educational experience conducive for the moral and character development of our pupils.

Catholic High School received its first batch of 33 GEP boys in January of 1998 under the care of 5 teachers. Since those early days, the programme has grown to its present size of 116 pupils in the three levels (P4-P6), and a teaching staff of 16.

#### DEPARTMENT VISION

The Catholic High GEP gentleman is a morally upright and effectively bilingual individual, who constantly strives for continuous improvement as a servant leader and critical thinker.

#### DEPARTMENT MISSION

To provide a quality and holistic educational experience to all our pupils by striving to balance the rigor of the enriched GE curriculum with the importance of values education.

To develop in our young gentlemen, the capacity to serve and excel in the VUCA world.

#### DEPARTMENT PHILOSOPHY

We believe that each pupil has his own talents. Coupled with a rigorous curriculum and caring environment that encourages creativity and critical thinking, the pupilsâ€™ talents are recognized, nurtured and ultimately, developed to help them on their journey to become responsible leaders who have a strong social conscience and commitment to serve others.
