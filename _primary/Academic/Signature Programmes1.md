#### Department Vision

The CH pupil possesses a fine mastery of the English language and demonstrates a love and an ardent appreciation in acquiring the language and a flair for its culture.

#### Reading Programme

A wide variety of books are placed in class for pupils to borrow and read. Our intent is to expose our pupils to as many writing styles and genres as possible, to widen their vocabulary as well as to provide them with the opportunity to apply the different writing styles and genres in their own writing. P3 and P4 pupils subscribe to the monthly newspaper ‘What’s Up’ while P5 and P6 pupils subscribe to INSPIRE, a quarterly magazine that features thought-provoking articles based on age-appropriate themes.

#### Speech and Drama

Speech and Drama is a springboard for developing effective communication skills and building confidence in our lower primary pupils. This programme allows pupils to express themselves freely, explore their imagination and learn a variety of speech and drama skills through fun, creative and engaging activities. All our P2 pupils will be given the opportunity to perform for an audience in Semester 2.

#### Philosophy for Children (P4C)

Philosophy for Children (P4C) has, since its introduction to the UK in the 1990s, developed as a powerful pedagogical approach and met with ever-increasing popularity. Questions and dialogue are central to P4C, which helps to develop pupils’ thinking skills, their confidence to speak and listen to others, and their respect of other people’s viewpoints. In Catholic High School, the English curriculum is enriched by the strategies in the STELLAR programme, extended by our Explicit Instructional Programme (EIP in-house resources) and enhanced with the integration of P4C into English language lessons.
