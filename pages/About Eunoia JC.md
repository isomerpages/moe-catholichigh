### Eunoia Junior College

**[Click here for Eunoia JC’s website](http://eunoiajc.moe.edu.sg/).**

#### Introduction

**Eunoia Junior College**&nbsp;is situated at the junction of Sin Ming Avenue and Marymount Road, overlooking Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park and both Bishan and Ang Mo Kio estates.

#### Facilities

Eunoia Junior College is the first high-rise junior college in Singapore, with two academic blocks 10 and 12 storeys high respectively. A library with splendid panoramic view towards Bishan Park sits at the top two floors of the 10-storey block, allowing all to be inspired by the green serenity of Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park. A 900-seater theatre will be equipped for performances, seminars and cohort-based lectures, on top of a range of seminar rooms, learning rooms, science laboratories and other special programme rooms.

The college is also the first school in Singapore with an elevated track and field stadium as part of its infrastructure. A full 8-lane track, field, space for sports and games, and a viewing gallery will be located at the top of the structure adjacent to Marymount Road. The field shelters various student interaction areas from the sun and rain, including music rooms, CCA rooms, a dance studio, a multi-purpose hall, a 900 pax auditorium and various arcades for mass activities.

#### Learning Experience

With Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park next door, the campus will be the foundation of our vision — the holistic development of every Eunoian to become a Youth with Purpose, Thinker with Heart, Leader with Courage. The abundance of nature is a reminder of Eunoians’ larger responsibility as individuals and leaders, and would greatly enhance the college’s Environmental Literacy Programme, Physical Education and Co-Curricular Activities programme.

Service to the community forms an important part of the Eunoia identity. Our students will enjoy many opportunities to connect with the residents of Bishan and Ang Mo Kio through community mapping and service learning programmes. The proximity of Bishan North Community Centre to the college will allow the college to weave community service seamlessly into our curriculum, as our Eunoians make a positive impact on the community.
