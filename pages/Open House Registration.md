**Open House Registration is Closed**

The Open House Registration is now closed due to the overwhelming response. To ensure the quality of the visitor experience, we seek your understanding that we have limited capacity for the event.  
For those who are unable to secure a slot, we have planned a virtual programme for you on the same day (21 May 2022)  from 10am-12noon. On top of the different videos showcasing our school and programmes, you will also get to hear our school leaders answer some of your questions in our “live” chat segment.

Please keep a look out for details that will be made available closer to 21 May [/openhouse](https://staging.d26k7rl81eo6rb.amplifyapp.com/prospective-students/open-house/)

For those who are successful, we will be notifying you via SMS / Email by next week.  

Thank you for your keen interest in Catholic High School – Home of the Leader, Gentleman and Bilingual Scholar!
