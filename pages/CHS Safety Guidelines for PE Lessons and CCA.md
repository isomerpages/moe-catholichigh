Regular physical activity, whether during Physical Education (PE) lessons or as part of a co-curricular programme, is essential for the normal, healthy growth and development of CHS pupils.  
The safety of our pupils during physical activities is our topmost priority. With this in mind, the school has in place safety procedures to minimize student injury. &nbsp;Pupils are also urged to comply with the following safety guidelines.

#### Safety Guidelines for Pupils

At the beginning of an activity, if you are unwell (slight flu, cough, headache, etc), inform the teacher/coach at the beginning of the activity. The teacher/coach will assess the situation and you may be excused from the activity.

1.  PE attire must be worn during PE lessons with T-shirts properly tucked. <br>
2.  Pupils are not allowed to wear watches or jewellery during PE lessons as they may cause injury to others during game sessions. <br>
3.  Bring along a bottle of water for any sport activity or ask for water breaks at the water coolers nearby to prevent dehydration.<br>
4.  Ensure that you have done the proper warm up activities and stretching exercises, as instructed by your teacher/coach. These exercises aim to strengthen your muscles and boost blood flow, which will reduce the occurrence of injury.<br>
5.  Allow your body to cool down after the activity.<br>
6.  Protective gear (such as helmets for softball) should always be used properly, as instructed by your teacher/coach.<br>
7.  Ensure that you handle PE/CCA equipment with care. <br>
8.  If you are hurt during PE lessons/CCA training, you should inform your teacher/coach immediately. If you experience pain or suspect injury, you should not return to the game/activity.<br>
9.  In the event of sudden illness or an accident during PE lessons/CCA training, the PE teacher/coach or a buddy will accompany you to the General Office to call your parent/guardian/care-giver, and first-aid will be administered to you. <br>
10.  If you have just recovered from the flu or a cold, ensure that you are medically fit before you engage in any physical activity. <br>
11.  Pay attention to your environment at all times. For example, do not play near the water feature at the parade square. <br>
12.  Only play at the playground when a teacher is on duty, follow the instructions carefully and use the equipment appropriately. <br>
13.  If your CCA session is conducted outdoors from 2.15 p.m. onwards, you are advised to take appropriate UV protection measures, such as:&nbsp;<br>
