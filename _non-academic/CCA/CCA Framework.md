#### REACH CCA Framework

In Catholic High School, CCA is regarded as a vital part of education and school life. Through active participation in CCA, we hope that every pupil will develop a sense of accomplishment and enhance his self-confidence by using his talents so as to prepare him for the challenges ahead.

Our CCA programme places great importance in fostering camaraderie, developing individual potential in sports and performing arts, instilling a life-long passion for the activity, inculcating leadership qualities, sportsmanship, building a robust character with a sound body and a disciplined mind and nurturing the gentleman in the child. Catholic High CCA programme works on the guiding principles of **RE**sponsibility, **A**chievement, **C**aring and **H**onesty (**REACH**).

All pupils are strongly encouraged to participate in one CCA. Based on talent identification screening, pupils are selected to join Sports or Performing Arts CCAs to further enhance their talents so as to enable them to maximise their potential, thus leading them to excel in the area of his interest.

##### SOAR (Structured and Organised Ability Recognition)

SOAR is a talent identification programme in Catholic High School. The objective of this programme is to identify potential talents of pupils as early as Primary One in the arena of aesthetics and sports so as to nurture and groom them towards excellence in their areas of interests.

#####  CCA Values In Action (VIA)

CCA VIA are learning experience that support pupils’ development as socially responsible citizens who contribute meaningfully to the community through the learning and application of values, knowledge and skills. In addition, CCA VIA also aims to nurture pupils into active contributors and concerned citizens. Upon completion of the VIA activity, pupils will undergo reflection process with their teachers. This will in turn help the pupils critically assess and understand what they see and do.

Providing service to others by members is one of the main focuses in CHS CCAs. By ensuring that each CCA organises VIA activity will definitely instil members with care and compassion for the less fortunate and the environment. The CCA members will be imbued with a sense of responsibility in enhancing the well-being of the community and the country.

##### Enrichment and Lifeskills

The Enrichment and Lifeskills(ENL)Programme focuses on enhances pupils’ learning experiences and supports their holistic development.

The school organises sports and aesthetics CCA games day for the members yearly. This allows them to come together as a CCA to compete against another CCA in various sports. Through participation in such activities, pupils develop character traits such as resilience, as well as increase perceived competence. This is also a platform to build team bonding and camaraderie among the CCA members.
