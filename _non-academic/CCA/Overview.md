### Our Philosophy

</style>
In Catholic High School, CCA is regarded as a vital part of education and school life. The vision for the CCA department is for every pupil to develop a sense of accomplishment and enhance his self-confidence through active participation in CCA. Guided strongly by the principles of **RE**sponsibility, **A**chievement, **C**aring and **H**onesty (**REACH**), the CCA department places great emphasis in fostering camaraderie, developing individual potential in sports and performing arts, instilling a life-long passion for the activity, inculcating leadership qualities, sportsmanship, as well as, developing robust character with a sound body and a disciplined mind.

#### Basketball

The Catholic High School Basketball CCA aims to train its players and develop their passion in playing basketball. Players train weekly to master physical skills and tactics that are key to playing the game. They also work on communication and collaboration on the court. They learn to play hard, play well, and most importantly, play together as a team. 

The CHS Basketball CCA puts great importance on seeing our gentlemen put in their best efforts, no matter the results of any match. Its greatest accomplishments do not come in the form of accolades or competitions won, but in developing the players’ positive qualities of humility, perseverance, and good sportsmanship

#### Softball

Softball provides our gentlemen with the opportunity to master fundamental skills and techniques such as throwing, catching, hitting for contact, hitting for power and running. These are the five types of skills that the softball coach would look out for and train the players. Fielding is also an important skill that our gentlemen learn in the CCA as it tests them on their agility and the ability to read a game situation. 

Through the rigorous training sessions, the teachers and coach ensure that the gentlemen have a positive softball experience. They will also instil in our gentlemen the confidence, build their character and help them learn values such as resilience, discipline and respect.

#### Table Tennis

Catholic High Table Tennis CCA focuses on building up a strong team spirit through discipline and commitment. Our training sessions involve honing our fundamental skills and we practise game play by sparring amongst ourselves. Good coordination skills and quick reaction time are necessary to excel in the sport.

As a sports CCA, we believe in cultivating good sportsmanship. Values such as resilience and respect are exhibited in our daily practices.

Besides the rigorous training sessions that we have regularly, we conduct team-bonding sessions and participate in VIA projects to serve and give back to the community. The strong camaraderie of the team is a key reason why we have been performing well in the National Schools Games.

#### Volleyball

The Volleyball CCA aims to equip our gentlemen with the skills of playing the sport and build one’s leadership qualities, resilience and discipline. We believe that each member of the CCA is able to maximise his potential if he gives his best during the training sessions.

Through the past competitions, our gentlemen have gained invaluable experience and learnt the value of sportsmanship. We strive to ensure that our members are able to play and appreciate the game of volleyball and to build a strong bond among them through the love of the sport.

#### Wushu

Wushu is an exact translation of the Chinese words where ‘wu’ means military or martial and ‘shu’ means art. 

In Catholic High School (Primary), we empower our gentlemen with skills to practise Wushu routine (套路) using different weapons and styles like Barehand (拳), Short Weapons (刀 & 剑) and Long Weapons like (枪 & 棍). 

Tapping on our gentlemen’s youthful energy, each training session engages them in robust routines that not only develop their physique and fitness but also strengthen their mental faculty.  Aside from the rigorous weekly training that inculcates discipline and diligence, our gentlemen are also involved in an annual VIA project. This platform teaches our gentlemen to be keenly aware of community needs and serve with empathy and love.

#### Chinese Orchestra

Chinese Orchestra (CO) offers our gentlemen a platform to hone their musical aptitude and deepen their appreciation for Chinese culture in line with the school's vision of nurturing bilingual scholars. Through engaging and enriching weekly training sessions, both sectional and combined, CO members have a chance to learn from dedicated instructors who not only impart technical skills but also nurture in the gentlemen a spirit of excellence and empower them to transform their musical prowess into inspiring performances that will bring joy to the community. 

The training sessions also abound in opportunities for inculcating diligence, perseverance and collaborative learning as members capitalise on the power of synergy, so that individual accomplishments can give rise to collective success. In the process, the gentlemen also foster endearing memories that they will treasure as they continue their journey into the melodious world of Chinese Orchestra.

#### Concert Band

Formed in 2003, the Catholic High School Concert Band (primary section) came into being with the objective of providing a 10-year Catholic High School Band programme together with the Catholic High School Symphony Band (secondary section) since Catholic High School is a full school with both primary and secondary sections.

In spite of its relative short history, it has demonstrated resoluteness in its continued pursuit of musical development and excellence.  From its humble inception, it went on to achieve Distinction at the 2018 Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation.

Over the years, the Catholic High School Concert Band has been a feature of community and school events, performing at the Shell-MOE School Band Fiesta XV at the Singapore Botanic Gardens, the annual public concert ‘Aesthetique’ with the Catholic High School Symphony Band and its own annual band gala night ‘Serenade’.

With the support from the school, band instructors, teachers, parents and secondary seniors, not only has the band learned to appreciate and play music, but good life values were also fostered in our young gentlemen as well, living up to the Band motto: One Band, One Sound, One Brotherhood.

#### Edward Becharas Choir

In Choir, our gentlemen develop singing, listening and performing skills when they learn to sing as one. They are given the opportunity to perform in various school and public events. The school also provides a fun and supportive environment that motivates and inspires our gentlemen to pursue their passion in choral singing and to hone their vocal abilities so as to discover their hidden talents.
   
Under the baton of the conductor, the Edward Becheras Choir endeavor to put up performances such as Founders’ Day and Primary 6 Thanksgiving Mass. 

Besides performing, Choir members also get to participate in exchange programmes and competitions to deepen their exposure and understanding of the choral art and to move towards excellence. We also engage in team building activities to build team cohesion and participate in VIA projects to give back to the community.

#### Modern Dance

Established in 2004, Catholic High Modern Dance was set up to showcase the talent that our young gentlemen exude. It has since grown from strength to strength, achieving the highest accolades in the biennial SYF Arts Presentation each time.

In the twice-weekly practice sessions, our gentlemen learn to execute rhythmic bodily movements with exemplary dance techniques, teamwork and showmanship through varied dance genres that encourage them to challenge their abilities and build their confidence.

Apart from appreciating dance as a performing art, our gentlemen also develop values such as empathy, responsibility, resilience, self-discipline and the drive to succeed in whatever they attempt through the process of learning to dance with their peers and opportunities to perform both in school and public platforms.

Modern Dance will endeavor to develop in our gentlemen a passion for dance and dance appreciation skills.

#### ARTSQUAD

ARTSQUAD is a platform for gentlemen with an interest in the visual arts to come together to learn, appreciate and create. Our budding gentlemen artists will be offered opportunities to develop deeper understanding and passion for the arts through explorations of different art medium and technology. There will also be learning opportunities to participate in arts activities outside of school, meet with practising artists, and work on collaborative projects with their peers.

Visual Art is a fundamental component of the human experience, reflecting the world and the time in which we live in, and the ubiquity of images in our everyday lives has progressively transformed the way we learn and perceive the world. Collectively as a CCA group, we hope to build greater awareness and appreciation for the arts and the community and society we live in.

### Cub Scouts

Cub Scouts CCA is about teamwork and learning important life skills. Scouting is a values based, educational movement accepting willingly a unique Scout Promise and Law as a guide of conduct. The Scouting’s principles are generally referred to as “Duty to Self”, “Duty to Others” and “Duty to Divine” which provide these guidelines. They are the basis of the value system which governs Scouting as a whole.

We strongly encourage our Cub Scouts to keep a Scouting journal to concretise their scouting experience through self-reflection thinking process so as to develop the maturity of perspective in life as they grow up.
