Under the strong guiding principles of the PE and CCA frameworks, Catholic High School PE Department implements Learning for Life (LLP) programme to focus on real-life experiential learning to develop pupils’ character and values. The name of the LLP programme is    "VITALS", which is the acronym for Values Infused Through Active Learning in Sports.
  
Through these signature programmes, pupils are able to discover their innate talents and potential on top of the fundamental and psycho-motor skills that they get to learn during their PE lessons.

### Wushu Programme
  
As a SAP school, Catholic High School PE Department works closely with the Chinese Department with the aim to develop effectively bilingual students pupils who are inculcated with in Chinese values. With that in mind, all Primary One 1 students pupils are introduced to a 5-week Wushu programme during PE lessons and they will learn Chinese martial arts footwork with a simple routine for fitness. Through this programme, students pupils will show appreciation for the Chinese culture, martial arts discipline and moral behaviour.

### Visit to Bishan Active Park   

As part of our PE syllabus for Outdoor Education module, we equip pupils with the knowledge, skills and attitude to explore the natural and urban environments safely and responsibly. As such, the Primary 4 pupils will experience a day trip to a neighouring park \- Bishan Active Park \- so as to have more authentic learning experiences.
