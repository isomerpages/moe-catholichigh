### Signature Programmes from PE department

The PE Department plans a series of activities and enrichments for our pupils. Under these signature programmes, pupils are able to discover their inert talents and potentials on top of the fundamental and psycho-motor skills that they get to learn during their PE lessons.

#### PE VIA

In Catholic High School (Primary), part of the Physical Education programme for the pupils is to cultivate them to be socially responsible citizens by contributing meaningfully to the community through learning and application of values, knowledge and skills. With that in mind, all the Primary Four pupils were accompanied by their Physical Education teachers to Bishan Active Park to perform Values-In-Action (VIA) activity by picking up litter in the park and were also inculcated with values of conserving the environment. At the end of the activity, the pupils were encouraged to pen down their thoughts and reflections, as well as how they can further enhance the well-being of the community.

#### Rockclimbing Programme

The Primary 4 pupils will also undergo rockclimbing lessons in school. One of benefits of rockclimbing is that it will develop and strengthen core muscles better than exercise routine and thus leading to a stronger, less injury prone body. Rockclimbing exercise will also enhance social emotional competencies, in particular, relationship management and responsible decision-making skills. By learning to put trust in the person holding their ropes will foster strong relationships and build rapport among the pupils. In addition, pupils will have to plan and make decision on the climbing routes that they would like to take on.

#### Catholic High School Primary Music

Music is integral to every human culture and opens doors to understanding others through a universal language. The primary music curriculum aims to develop students’ musical skills of performing, listening and creating. Students will also develop life-long skills such as critical thinking, problem solving and teamwork.

In Catholic High School, we want to nurture students to become open-minded individuals who show appreciation for musical diversity and to continue to have meaningful participation in music in daily life through adulthood.

Over the course of 6 years, students will be exposed to different instruments and musical cultures. They will also be given opportunities to perform and showcase their musical talents through physical and virtual platforms.

#### Ethnic Percussion Programme

As a SAP school, Catholic High School Music department works closely with the SAP committee to develop a profile of students with a deep understanding and appreciation of diverse cultures. Primary Two students learn to play various ethnic percussion instruments such as Indian Zills, Malay Kompangs and Chinese drums over a 5-week Ethnic Percussion programme during music lessons. Besides learning the techniques to play the various ethnic instruments, students are taught to play as an ensemble. Through playing music together as an ensemble, students develop better listening skills.
