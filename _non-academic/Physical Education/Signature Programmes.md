Under the strong guiding principles of the PE and CCA frameworks, Catholic High School PE Department implements Learning for Life (LLP) programme to focus on real-life experiential learning to develop pupils’ character and values. The name of the LLP programme is    "VITALS", which is the acronym for Values Infused Through Active Learning in Sports.
  
Through these signature programmes, pupils are able to discover their innate talents and potential on top of the fundamental and psycho-motor skills that they get to learn during their PE lessons.

### Wushu Programme
  
As a SAP school, Catholic High School PE Department works closely with the Chinese Department with the aim to develop effectively bilingual students pupils who are inculcated with in Chinese values. With that in mind, all Primary One 1 students pupils are introduced to a 5-week Wushu programme during PE lessons and they will learn Chinese martial arts footwork with a simple routine for fitness. Through this programme, students pupils will show appreciation for the Chinese culture, martial arts discipline and moral behaviour.

### Visit to Bishan Active Park   

As part of our PE syllabus for Outdoor Education module, we equip pupils with the knowledge, skills and attitude to explore the natural and urban environments safely and responsibly. As such, the Primary 4 pupils will experience a day trip to a neighouring park \- Bishan Active Park \- so as to have more authentic learning experiences.

### Primary 5 Camp 

The P5 Camp seeks to develop ruggedness and resilience in our students, and build cohesion amongst them. Using the outdoors as the ‘classroom’ for learning and development, it provides a unique opportunity for them to work together as a small team and to overcome various outdoor challenges.

**Through the camp, our pupils will be able to:**
- develop their character and build leadership skills;
- build friendships amongst their team members and actively help one another to achieve team goals in an inclusive manner; and
- understand the importance of caring for the environment.

### Sports Day 

Besides providing opportunities for pupils to acquire and revisit the skills through physical activities, the PE department also creates platforms for recreational participation such as Lower Primary Sports Carnival and Upper Primary Sports Day. Lower primary pupils will go through a series of games stations that allow them to make use of their acquired fundamental skills such as gymnastics with the inclusion of forward and log rolls; locomotor skills such as running and skipping; non-locomotor skills such as balancing and manipulative skills such as rolling a ball and executing an underarm throw.

Upper Primary Sports day is designed to provide the pupils opportunities to apply the tactics, techniques, concepts and strategies that they have learnt in PE lessons to inter-class games settings. There are four inter-class games, namely Volleyball, Basketball, Floorball and Soccer. Each pupil will represent his class in one of the four games. The four games are chosen with the notion that they are net barrier and invasion games and are part of the revised PE syllabus. Throughout their years of acquiring skills in PE lessons, they will be able to make informed choices on the games that they have demonstrated flair in and to continue to excel in it through this annual event. This will enhance their self-mastery and emotional competencies.
