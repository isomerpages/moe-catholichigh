Under the strong guiding principles of the PE and CCA frameworks, Catholic High School PE Department implements Learning for Life (LLP) programme to focus on real-life experiential learning to develop pupils’ character and values. The name of the LLP programme is    "VITALS", which is the acronym for Values Infused Through Active Learning in Sports.
  
Through these signature programmes, pupils are able to discover their innate talents and potential on top of the fundamental and psycho-motor skills that they get to learn during their PE lessons.

### Wushu Programme
