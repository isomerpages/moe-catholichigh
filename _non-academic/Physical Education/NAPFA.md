#### Safety Guidelines for NAPFA Test

1.  Ensure that all the NAPFA testers have attended the NAPFA Testers’ course. Other teachers assisting in the NAPFA test must be thoroughly briefed by a qualified tester in the school.
2.  Advise pupils not to take the test if they are unwell or are suffering from acute infection (e.g. viral influenza, chest infection) or injury.
3.  Advise pupils not to continue exercising should significant medical problems (including infections and injuries) develop, as it may result in serious complications and even death. They should resume training only after they have fully recovered and should progress gradually.
4.  Ensure that pupils warm-up and cool down before and after the test.
5.  Advise pupils not to consume heavy meals 1-2 hours before the test.
6.  Ensure that pupils wear sports or PE attire, i.e. short-sleeved T-shirt, shorts and sports or PE shoes. Shoes with worn out soles are not safe and should not be used during the test.
7.  Advise pupils who are less fit to start with low intensity training from the beginning of the school year and progress gradually.
8.  Note that the 1.6 km/2.4 km. run/walk test should preferably be conducted before 10 am and after 4 pm when the weather is relatively cooler.
9.  Ensure that water and First Aid stations are available during the test.
10.  The following categories of pupils are completely exempted from the NAPFA Test:
    1.  Pupils with medical problems (e.g. heart problems, soft bones etc.) and/or those advised not to participate by the SHS after their annual check-up.
    2.  Pupils with medical certificates for serious/long-term illnesses, e.g. cancer, hole in the heart, etc.
    3.  Pupils with physical disabilities.
    4.  Pupils recovering from fractured arm/foot/leg or serious illnesses such as chicken pox or dengue fever.
    5.  New cases of severely overweight pupils who have yet to obtain a certification of fitness from the School Health Service.
11.  Ensure that the following categories of pupils with minor illnesses are excused on the NAPFA test days:
    1.  Pupils with medical certificates.
    2.  Pupils with parents’ letter stating that they are not well.
    3.  Pupils whom teachers have observed to be unwell.
    4.  Pupils who report sick
12.  Accept all MCs and parents’ letters at face value. Pupils having minor illnesses such as mild flu, cold and cough (without chest infections), slight fever, menstrual cramps and diarrhea should take the test two weeks later when they have fully recovered.
