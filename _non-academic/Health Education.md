### Health Education

#### Health Charter

Catholic High School is committed to promoting the physical, social and mental well-being of its students, stakeholders and community through innovative and sustainable programmes.


#### Holistic Health Framework


#### Health Ambassadors 
The department train and equip our ambassadors to monitor the school canteen food. They learn the canteen guidelines before they embark on the canteen checks. The pupils also monitor what their schoolmates are eating and give advice on healthier choices. They report to both the OM and the PSG coordinator for nutrition. The health ambassadors are rotated every semester to enable more pupils to experience the position.
