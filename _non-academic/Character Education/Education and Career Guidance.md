#### Overview and Purpose

Education and Career Guidance (ECG) is developmental in nature, and seeks to meet the needs of pupils at every stage of their education.  Through ECG, pupils develop social emotional competencies and qualities of proactivity, adaptability and resilience that will prepare them for the 21st century.

ECG lessons and experiences, complemented by MySkillsFuture portal, enable pupils to make informed education and career choices, and empower them for lifelong learning.

The goals of ECG are to:

*   Nurture pupils’ self-awareness, self-directedness and life skills for continuous learning.
*   Provide pupils with accurate and comprehensive information and enable them to explore well-thought through education and career options.
*   Instil in pupils an appreciation for the value of all occupations and how they contribute to the society.
*   Equip pupils with skills to positively engage their parents and other career influencers such as teachers, trusted adults and industry experts.

#### Approach and Learning Experience

Our approach to ECG is guided by a developmental model by the Ministry of Education:

The ECG Developmental Model highlights education and career development as a process that takes place over one’s life span, with three progressive emphases of Awareness, Exploration and Planning.  Awareness, Exploration and Planning are necessary for all levels of pupils.  However, there are different emphases at the different levels to meet varying developmental needs.

For Primary School, the emphasis is on awareness:

1.  Awareness of interests, abilities and career aspirations
2.  Relation of self to others and work
3.  Initial preferences in occupational roles assumed in play

At Catholic High School (CHS), ECG lessons have been incorporated into Form-Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP) and Programme for Active Learning (PAL) lessons since Primary 1, where pupils are guided to learn more about self-awareness, self-directedness and life skills for continuous learning.  These lessons are designed to raise pupils’ self-awareness of their strengths and interests, which are helpful for pupils to plan their educational pathways, open up their horizon to different occupations and nurture their aspirations for the future.

From Primary 5 onwards, the pupils will be guided to make use of the MySkillsFuture portal to explore various education and career pathways.  Through this exploration, pupils will have accurate and comprehensive information and appreciate the value of the education and occupation choices and how they can contribute to the society.

ECG is also purposely incorporated into school-based programme, i.e. Teach me to Fish (TM2F), to provide our pupils with a more enriching and meaningful ECG learning experience.
