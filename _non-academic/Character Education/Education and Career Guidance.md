<h4>Overview and Purpose</h4>
<p>Education and Career Guidance (ECG) is developmental in nature, and seeks
to meet the needs of pupils at every stage of their education.&nbsp; Through
ECG, pupils develop social emotional competencies and qualities of proactivity,
adaptability and resilience that will prepare them for the 21st century.</p>
<p>ECG lessons and experiences, complemented by MySkillsFuture portal, enable
pupils to make informed education and career choices, and empower them
for lifelong learning.</p>
<p>The goals of ECG are to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Nurture pupils’ self-awareness, self-directedness and life skills for
continuous learning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide pupils with accurate and comprehensive information and enable
them to explore well-thought through education and career options.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Instil in pupils an appreciation for the value of all occupations and
how they contribute to the society.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Equip pupils with skills to positively engage their parents and other
career influencers such as teachers, trusted adults and industry experts.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Approach and Learning Experience</h4>
<p>Our approach to ECG is guided by a developmental model by the Ministry
of Education:</p>

<img style="width:60%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/cce15.png">
</div>
<p>The ECG Developmental Model highlights education and career development
as a process that takes place over one’s life span, with three progressive
emphases of Awareness, Exploration and Planning.&nbsp; Awareness, Exploration
and Planning are necessary for all levels of pupils.&nbsp; However, there
are different emphases at the different levels to meet varying developmental
needs.</p>
<p>For Primary School, the emphasis is on awareness:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Awareness of interests, abilities and career aspirations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Relation of self to others and work</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Initial preferences in occupational roles assumed in play</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>At Catholic High School (CHS), ECG lessons have been incorporated into
Form-Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP) and Programme for Active Learning (PAL)
lessons since Primary 1, where pupils are guided to learn more about self-awareness,
self-directedness and life skills for continuous learning.&nbsp; These
lessons are designed to raise pupils’ self-awareness of their strengths
and interests, which are helpful for pupils to plan their educational pathways,
open up their horizon to different occupations and nurture their aspirations
for the future.</p>
<p>From Primary 5 onwards, the pupils will be guided to make use of the MySkillsFuture
portal to explore various education and career pathways.&nbsp; Through
this exploration, pupils will have accurate and comprehensive information
and appreciate the value of the education and occupation choices and how
they can contribute to the society.</p>
<p>ECG is also purposely incorporated into school-based programme, i.e. Teach
me to Fish (TM2F), to provide our pupils with a more enriching and meaningful
ECG learning experience.</p>
