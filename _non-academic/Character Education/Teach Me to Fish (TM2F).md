#### Overview and Purpose

_Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime.’   <br> ~  (Unknown)  ~_

Teach Me to Fish at Catholic High School (Primary) is a customised experiential learning programme for P1 to P6 pupils, focusing on building life skills competencies in our pupils.  We believe that life skills competencies are necessary for the overall development of pupils.  These competencies are the knowledge, skills, attitudes and behaviours that pupils need to possess to become healthy and well-balanced individuals.  The pupils’ ability to manage self would mean a higher degree of success in managing other areas in their lives.  

#### Approach and Experience

At Catholic High School (Primary), we use experiential learning approach to provide pupils with a cycle of experiences, observation, reflection and application to acquire practical skills for personal effectiveness in the following areas:

*   Practising everyday responsibilities in daily lives;
*   Cultivating good habits for life;
*   Respecting others through taking care of shared spaces; and
*   Building independent and confident individuals.

It takes a village to raise a child.  In order to strengthen the effectiveness of TM2F programme, we partner with families and community to create a holistic education for our pupils.  Families are encouraged to provide opportunities for our pupils to put into practice at home the skills that they have learnt through the programme for reinforcement and consistency.  In the event when interaction between pupils and external partners is allowed, parent volunteers from the Parent Support Group will provide hands-on coaching and guidance for our pupils.
