#### Overview and Purpose

_“We won’t have a society if we destroy the environment.”  <br>— Margaret Mead_

The focus of our environmental environment is to cultivate a sense of ownership for the environment and to encourage and provide opportunities for pupils to make responsible decisions using the 3As’ approach (see figure 1).  From a young age, our gentlemen are taught the importance of our environment and to take personal responsibility for their immediate learning environment to our planet at large. 

#### Approach and Experience

Environmental Education at Catholic High School (CHS) has also been infused in many subjects and programmes.  Some of the examples include the following:

1.  Discussion on the types and effects of pollution and creation of cell models using recycled materials in Science lessons;
2.  Creation of self-portrait and 3D models of the future Singapore using recycled materials in Art lessons;
3.  Discussion on one’s role in caring for the environment and making of tote bags using old T-shirt in Social Studies lessons;
4.  Probing pupils’ preconceived notion of what their environment entails in The Philosophy for Children lessons found within the school’s English syllabus; and
5.  Cultivation of sense of ownership for the environment through outdoor gardening, making of compost using natural resources and learning the importance of solar energy with Lego renewable energy activities in Programme for Active Learning (PAL) lessons.

These activities promote pupils’ appreciation for nature and heighten their self-awareness and social-awareness.

These are further reinforced with the implementation of school-based environmental initiatives and projects.  Some of the examples include daily wipe-down activities, the recycling programme in every classroom, which is further boosted by the implementation of the Positive Classroom Culture Award. This rewards a class per level per term for the best representation of the amalgamation of both positive culture and environment consciousness aspects within the classroom.  Our school also organises Youth for the Environment Day (YED) on an annual basis, to engage our gentlemen to champion environmental ownership by participating in programmes to show their commitment towards environmental issues.
