#### Overview and Purpose

As Form Teachers play a central role in shaping the development of their young charges, the Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP) has been introduced in all primary schools since 2012.

The Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP) is a dedicated period within the curriculum time for Primary 1 to Primary 6 in which the form teachers focus on building positive relationships with their pupils and equipping and strengthening their social and emotional competencies.

Social and Emotional Learning (SEL) lessons in FTGP are designed for pupils to acquire life skills that will help them to:

1.  better understand themselves (Self-Awareness)
2.  learn ways to manage themselves (Self-Management)
3.  better understand their family and friends (Social Awareness)
4.  learn ways to work with their family and friends (Relationship Management)
5.  make appropriate and responsible decisions (Responsible Decision Making)

#### Approach and Leaning Experience

The FTGP lessons are conveyed through stories, interactive activities and discussions that include handling of challenging situations constructively and making responsible decisions.  Pupils’ SEL is further enhanced with reinforcement through the FTGP journals where pupils would pen their thoughts following a period of self-reflection with their teachers and classmates.

Pupils’ active participation during FTGP lessons.

Apart from teaching the SEL lessons, form teachers also conduct chit-chat sessions with their pupils in 1-1 Teacher-Pupil Interaction Time during FTGP.  Such informal chit-chat sessions allow teachers to know more about their pupils so that they are able to guide and support them in the areas that were surfaced during interaction time.
