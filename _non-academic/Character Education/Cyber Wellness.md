#### Overview and Purpose

Cyber Wellness (CW) in Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) focuses on the well-being of our pupils as they navigate cyberspace. Our curriculum aims to equip pupils with the knowledge and skills to harness the power of ICT for positive purposes, maintain a positive presence in cyberspace and be safe and responsible users of ICT.

#### Approach and Learning Experience

Our approach to CW is guided by the CW Principles by the Ministry of Education:

The three principles, ‘Respect for Self and Others’, ‘Safe and Responsible Use’ and ‘Positive Peer Influence’ when adhered to will anchor a child’s well-being in cyberspace as he will then be able to make careful and well-considered decisions.

CW Education at Catholic High School is delivered across various learning platforms:

1.  CW lessons via Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP);
2.  School-wide programmes (e.g. CW assembly talks, CW morning sharing, Peer Support Leaders’ CW Workshop and CW activities); and
3.  CW topics that are included in subjects such as English and Mother Tongue Languages.
