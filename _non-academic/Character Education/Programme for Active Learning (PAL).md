#### Approach and Learning Experience

PAL lessons are designed to have the following characteristics:  

*   Experiential in nature
*   Encompass learning in a creative way
*   Provide opportunities for children (individually and in teams) to create
*   Fun and enjoyable
*   Incorporate Character Development and Social Emotional Learning (e.g. self-discovery, self-respect, respect for others, team work and leadership)

Our pupils will have the opportunities to try out activities in the 4 domains every year, which are Sports and Games, Outdoor Education, Performing Arts and Visual Arts and Outdoor Education.  These experiential learning opportunities allow our pupils to discover their talents and interests and at the same time, acquire confidence, curiosity and cooperation skills that will prepare them for the future ahead.

The focus of our Outdoor Education is to cultivate a sense of ownership for the environment and to encourage and provide opportunities for pupils to make responsible decisions. Aligning to the national initiative of home gardening and strengthening Singapore’s food resilience, we have our Primary 2 boys to try out outdoor gardening since 2021. They are taught on how to make compost using natural resources and grow their own plants using recycled containers.

In addition, we have also put in place Lego education activities for our Primary 2 pupils and teach them about the importance of renewable energy sources and provide opportunity for them to acquire critical thinking and problem solving skills using the Lego renewable energy set.
