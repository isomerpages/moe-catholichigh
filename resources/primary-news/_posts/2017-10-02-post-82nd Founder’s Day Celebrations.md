### 82nd Founder’s Day Celebrations (Friday, 13 October 2017)

The occasion will be commemorated by a Thanksgiving Mass that will be held in the School Hall followed by classroom activities that revolve around the theme _‘Community in Service’_.

Your child/ward has been informed of an online activity that he is encouraged to complete with your supervision. Please visit [www.freerice.com](http://www.freerice.com/) to complete the activity. There is NO requirement to sign up for an account. Your child/ward is to answer questions pertaining to English or Mathematics. For every correct answer, the banner ad that you see generates enough money for the World Food Programme to buy 10 grains of rice to help reach Zero Hunger. This non-profit website which is supported by the UN aims to end world hunger by providing rice to the underprivileged in the world for free.

Through this activity, we hope to inculcate values such as empathy and compassion for others in our pupils and raise awareness of the many people in the world community living in extreme hunger and poverty. We seek your continued support in developing our children into responsible citizens.
