**PSLE Graduation Thanksgiving Mass 2013**

Dear Parents of P6 students,

We come together at this time to celebrate the graduation of our Primary 6 students and rejoice in how our God has provided for them throughout their journey. As they prepare to embark on a new phase in their lives, we gather to recognize the contributions of all the teachers, assistants, administrators, caretakers and support staff in this school community but most of all, we take this opportunity to offer our thanksgivings to our Lord who accompanies us ceaselessly as we take yet another step toward the future. We welcome all to join us in our celebration of the Eucharist on:

Date: 3 September 2013

Time: 12.45 – 1.45 pm (Please be seated by 12.30pm)

Venue: Secondary School Auditorium

Celebrant: Rev Fr Henry Siew

Parents are also invited to join us in prayer during the examination days beginning on 26 Sept. Prayer sessions are held in the St Peter & Pauls’ Room at the Secondary Block, 5th Level.
