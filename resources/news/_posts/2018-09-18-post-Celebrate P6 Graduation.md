As they prepare to embark on a new phase in their lives, we gather to recognise the contributions of all the teachers, administrators, and support staff in this school community. Most of all, we take this opportunity to offer our thanksgivings to our Lord who accompanies us ceaselessly as we take yet another step toward the future.
