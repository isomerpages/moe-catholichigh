Dear Pupils:

This Teacher’s Day, you can show appreciation to your teachers through our “Love Project”. You can submit the following items

1) Draw a picture  
2) Write a poem  
3) Draw a comic  
4) Create a video (not more than 5 mins)

• You can burn your video in a CD and submit it to the general office or save it in thumbdrive and pass it to Ms Chong Ai Lin or Ms Chew Boey Tin.

You can submit your entry as an individual work or group work.

The best piece of work for each category will be shown to the school on Teacher’s Day celebration.
