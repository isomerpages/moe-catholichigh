Dear parents,

We begin the Season of Lent once again …a time for us and our family to walk with Jesus in our journey – and contemplate the Passion of Christ. Time for us to exercise one of the three disciplines during Lent – prayer – as we pray the Stations of the Cross.

Stations are places where people wait while they are going from one place to another. Stations are also places where people take time to think about Jesus as he sacrificed his life for us. The Stations of the Cross show us how much Jesus loved us.

Do join us on these Fridays for the Stations of the Cross with your children on:

Dates – 7, 28 March, 4 & 11 April

Venue – PRIMARY School Chapel

Time – 7.15am

God Bless!
