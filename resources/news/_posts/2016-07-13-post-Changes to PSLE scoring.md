Changes to the Primary School Leaving Examinations (PSLE) scoring and Secondary One (S1) posting will be made as part of a larger shift to nurture well-rounded individuals and move away from an over-emphasis on academic results.

To be implemented starting from the 2021 PSLE cohort, the changes aim to:

– Reduce fine differentiation of students

– Reflect a student’s level of achievement regardless of how his peers have done

– Encourage families to choose schools based on their suitability for the child’s learning needs, talents and interests.
