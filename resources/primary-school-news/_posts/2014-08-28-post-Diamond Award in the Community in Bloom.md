To commemorate 10 years since the launch of Community in Bloom initiative this year, NParks introduced a new category within the biannual Community in Bloom Awards called the ‘Diamond Award’. It was introduced to recognise outstanding community gardens that been exemplary in their horticultural standards, aesthetics, and community engagement over a minimum of 6 years. To qualify for this inaugural award, a community garden would need to have obtained three consecutive Platinum Awards in the biannual Community in Bloom Awards between 2008 and 2014.

Our school achieved the Diamond Award in the Community in Bloom Awards 2014. Our garden is one of the 3 educational institutes and one of the 15 from over 700 community gardens in Singapore to have been accorded this prestigious award!
