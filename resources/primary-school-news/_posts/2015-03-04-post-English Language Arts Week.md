Exciting activities await you in Term 2 Week 3 (6th April to 10th April) which marks the start of English Language Arts Week! In the meantime, you are encouraged to read the recommended classic adventure novel ‘Around the World in 80 Days’ by Jules Verne as our activities revolve around the places mentioned in the book.
