Congratulations to our two **Lee Kuan Yew Award for All-Round Excellence and Lee Hsien Loong Award for Outstanding All-Round Achievement winners!**

One of first batch of IP students, **Benjamin Soh (Head Prefect 2015-2016)**, has done the school proud. Benjamin, currently in Eunoia Junior College, was awarded this afternoon the prestigious Lee Kuan Yew Award for All-Round Excellence for his exemplary track records in CHS.
