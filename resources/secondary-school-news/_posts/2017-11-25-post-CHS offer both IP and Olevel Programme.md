Dear P6 Pupils and Parents,

**Catholic High School offers both Integrated Programme and O-Level Programme**.

We have been incidentally left out in the listing of IP schools in the MOE ECG Resource Kit given out to P6 pupils at this year’s PSLE results release.

A **corrected copy of the above [MOE ECG Resource Kit](https://www.moe.gov.sg/whatsnextafterpsle)** is available at:

*   [https://www.moe.gov.sg/whatsnextafterpsle](https://www.moe.gov.sg/whatsnextafterpsle)

Please note the above when making your choice of secondary schools.
