We join our parents and students in celebrating the tremendous success of the 2017 O-level Programme students, who received their O-level examination results last Friday.

Their performance was the best in the past few years, with higher distinction rates in many subjects including English (more than 64% Distinctions) and Mathematics (more than 90% Distinctions). Furthermore, a higher percentage of students as compared to previous years obtained 8 Distinctions or more, with many obtaining 9 and 10 Distinctions.

We are all proud of our Class of 2017, and we wish our OP and IP students all the best for their future endeavours!
