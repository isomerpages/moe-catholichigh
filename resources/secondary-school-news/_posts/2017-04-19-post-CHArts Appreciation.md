Two evenings of spectacular SYF performances “CHArts Appreciation” are in store for you this April!

On 20th April, get blown away by our Symphony Band with their three pieces. “Sunny Island” depicts different scenes in Singapore; “Train to Bishan” traces the train journey of a CHS student on his way to school; and “Deep Purple Medley” is a compilation of favourite hits by the rock group, Deep Purple.

Next up, be enthralled by our Edward Becheras Choir, which will be presenting three pieces- “Bunga Sayang”, a familiar Asian tune; “Justorum Animae”, a Latin Offertory; and an exciting composition by Francisco Feliciano.

Wrapping up the night, let your heart and mind be warmed and cheered by our Chinese Drama Society’s “Mud, 泥土”.

On 21st April, be thrilled by the Chinese Orchestra’s motivational and energetic set piece “焰火”, as well as their heart wrenching and sorrowful piece, “悲歌悼情”.

Next, be inspired by our Modern Dancers’ “Backpacked”, as our dancers embody the spirit of determination and resilience.

Be captivated by the finale performance “Long Ya Men” from our English Drama Society, which tells a tale set in the 18th century about a group of Chinese peasants who escaped from a failed rebellion. The men followed the advice of four wise sages and embarked on a gruelling journey to find a land of peace.

Let’s support all our performing arts groups! Come down to CHArts Appreciation and cheer on our brothers for their performances
