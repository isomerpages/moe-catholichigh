_Dear Parents,_

MOE has provided our school with exhibition posters of proposed retrofitting of the new Eunoia JC’s holding site at Mount Sinai Road. We have put up an exhibition of these posters at the foyer outside our General Office, where our students can view them. You can view these posters, as scrolling slides, below. In addition, the new Eunoia JC team and our school held a sharing of the details to the IP students after the end-of-year examinations.
