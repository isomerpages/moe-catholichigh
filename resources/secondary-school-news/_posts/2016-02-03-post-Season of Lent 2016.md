7.15am sharp SEC SCH HALL  
Ash Wednesday begins the Season of Lent in the Catholic Church.

This season prepares the faithful before the celebration of Easter. It is also a time for our own reflection and spiritual renewal.

We begin the Lenten season with a liturgical celebration with the imposition of ashes as a symbol of our penance (ashes symbolising grief, in penance for our sinfulness); and in so doing, help us develop a spirit of humility and sacrifice.

All Catholics are encouraged to participate in this rite. All are welcome. Any inconvenience caused is sincerely regretted. God Bless!
