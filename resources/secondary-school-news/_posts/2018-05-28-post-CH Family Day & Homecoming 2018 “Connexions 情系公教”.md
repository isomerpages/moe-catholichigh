#### CH Family Day & Homecoming 2018 “Connexions 情系公教”

Date and Time: **30th June, 8:30 AM – 3:00 PM**

Our CH Family Day & Homecoming is a fun-filled and meaningful event where all the pupils, parents, teachers, old boys, school partners and the general public come together as one big family to mingle and build bonds so that every life is touched. Furthermore, our students will showcase their entrepreneurial spirit through setting up games, merchandise and food stalls throughout the day to entertain the crowd.

Join us on that day (and you can buy carnival coupons on the spot or from any CHS staff/students at $10/coupon sheet)!
