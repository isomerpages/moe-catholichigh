Congratulations to Our Prime Minister’s Book Prize Winner
---------------------------------------------------------

**We heartiest congratulations to our alumni Ong Chong Yu (Integrated Programme, Class of 2017) for being awarded the prestigious Prime Minister’s Book Prize 2018!** Established in 1974, the Prime Minister’s Book Prize is a national award recognising outstanding students for bilingualism. Chong Yu was a Bicultural Studies Programme scholar and President of our Chinese Orchestra during his years in CHS, and he is now a BSP scholar and Student Council Deputy President in Eunoia Junior College. We wish him all the best as he continues his journey as a Bilingual Scholar, Leader and Gentleman!
