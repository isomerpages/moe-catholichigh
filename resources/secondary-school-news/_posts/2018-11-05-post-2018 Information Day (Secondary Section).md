### 2018 Information Day (Secondary Section)

Our **2018 Information Day will be held on 22 No 2018 (the day of PSLE results release), from 12.00noon to 5.00pm** at our Multi-Purpose Room (MPR), located near our school’s main gate on Bishan Street 22. No registration is required, and our staff will be around to answer your queries about CHS.

Our major Open House is in May, and this Information Day is an additional avenue for P6 parents and students to seek more information or clarification. Families can also go on a self-guided tour around our school campus.
