Our student, Jackie Lau, along with our EJC student Damien Teo (from CHS IP class of 2016) and EJC, SNGS and SCGS students participated as a team “J.I.P 小组” in the “新空下-新谣歌唱与创作比赛” and have made it into the grand finals! Their team is in fact the only combined school team with members from more than one school.

**The grand finals will be held on 12 August 2017, 6.30pm, at the Singapore Polytechnic convention centre**.
