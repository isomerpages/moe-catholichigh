### CHArts Appreciation 2019

<img src="/images/sn8.png" style="width:80%">

With discipline, dedication and hours of hardwork, our Performing Arts Brothers have put their heart and soul into their SYF performances this year. This couldn’t have been possible without the support and guidance of our teachers, parents, instructors and peers.

In order to show appreciation to everyone who has helped us give our best, we will be having our very own CHArts Appreciation on the **26 of April, 2019** from **7pm** onwards!

From the bottom of our hearts, we would like to thank everyone who has made our SYF journey a memorable and enriching one!
