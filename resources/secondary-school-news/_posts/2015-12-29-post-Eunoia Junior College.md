We are pleased to inform that the new Government Junior College has been named. At the Appointment and Appreciation Ceremony for Principals on 29 December 2015, Acting Minister for Education (Schools) Ng Chee Meng announced that the College will be named **Eunoia Junior College**.

Eunoia is a rarely-used but strikingly meaningful English word with Greek origins. It points towards one of the key tenets of the College vision – of how a “Thinker with Heart” is essentially someone with a beautiful mind and a deep reservoir of goodwill towards others around him. This represents the College’s commitment towards nurturing every graduate of the College in exemplifying a strong spirit of eunoia, which would act as a solid anchor for his pursuit of excellence as a “Youth with Purpose” and a “Leader with Courage”. Eunoia is also the shortest English word containing all five vowels, signifying the completeness and well-roundedness that will characterise the graduates of the College.
