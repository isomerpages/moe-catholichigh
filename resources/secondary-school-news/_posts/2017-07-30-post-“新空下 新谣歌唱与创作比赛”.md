Our student, Jackie Lau, along with our EJC student Damien Teo (from CHS IP class of 2016) and EJC, SNGS and SCGS students participated as a team “J.I.P 小组”&nbsp;in the “新空下-新谣歌唱与创作比赛” and have made it into the grand finals! Their team&nbsp;is in fact the only combined school team with members from more than one school.

**The&nbsp;grand finals will be held on 12 August 2017, 6.30pm, at the Singapore Polytechnic convention centre**.


Here’s a photo of the team “J.I.P 小组” at the semi-finals:
