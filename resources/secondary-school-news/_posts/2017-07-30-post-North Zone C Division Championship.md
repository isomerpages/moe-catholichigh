**Our Basketballers and Volleyballers have  in the past weeks clinched the North Zone C-Division Championship title for their respective sports!**

We are proud of our gentlemen’s sportsmanship, discipline and tenacity throughout the season, and we wish them all the best for their National games. These achievements cap our gentlemen’s successes in the B-Div Softball and B-Div Table Tennis arenas up till this point of 2017. Our other ball sports, namely Softball and Floorball, are still in pursuit of the C-Div National titles.

Here’s short video of our Volleyballers in action at the recent NZ C-Div championship match:
