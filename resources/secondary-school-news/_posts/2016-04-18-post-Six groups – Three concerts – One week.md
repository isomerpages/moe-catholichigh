Six groups – Three concerts – One week

April is filled with excitement and a display of creativity as our performing arts groups take centrestage with public performances at the newly renovated Victoria Concert Hall and Theatre, and at The School of the Arts Concert Hall.

Come and be swept away by our English Language Drama (ELD) at Victoria Theatre as the stage is transformed into a Pacific Island for “That Day on the Island”, an adaptation of Golding’s novel, “Lord of the Flies”. See how the stage transforms back into modern Singapore, as our Chinese Language Drama (CLD) lightens the mood with a comedy based on conflict and resolution between an all-male and all-female drama troupes. Alongside the drama presentation, our Modern Dance presents a series of contemporary dance with elements of hip-hop, street dance, Jazz and cultural dance.

Wonder why it’s entitled War and Peace for Chinese Orchestra (CO) and Symphony Band (SB) concert? Come and experience an aural sensation as CO vibrates Victoria Concert Hall with “十面埋伏” and “飞天” while SB soothes the place with Ticheli’s “Angels in the Architecte” and “Dona Nobis Pacem” (Grant Us Peace).

Last but not least, be enchanted by our Edward Becheras Choir with a wide range of songs from “Salve Regina” and “Northern Lights” (Latin text) to medleys of Beatles’ songs, and Singaporean 新谣 such as “一步一步来”and “细水长流” by our own alumni, Mr Liang Wenfu.

Tickets are available through students and teachers of the respective CCAs.
