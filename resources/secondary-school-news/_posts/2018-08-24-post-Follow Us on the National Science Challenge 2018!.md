A team of our Level 3 [CΩERGY](https://catholichigh.moe.edu.sg/c%CF%89ergy-programme/) students are presently competing in the ongoing National Science Challenge 2018 being broadcasted on MediaCorp Chanel 5. After the broadcasted [28 Aug quarterfinal episode](https://video.toggle.sg/en/video/series/national-science-challenge-2018/ep2/624496), our team is through to the semi-finals!
