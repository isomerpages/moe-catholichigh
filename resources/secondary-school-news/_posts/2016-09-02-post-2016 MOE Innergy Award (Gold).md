**Congratulations to our geography teachers, Lead Teacher Mrs Michele Lau, Ms Syuhaida and Mr Winfred Oh for winning the 2016 MOE Innergy Award (Gold)** for their project on game-based learning for Geography, ‘Sovereign City’. Our students have learned through this game when they were taught the topic of “Energy”.

The Innergy award (results announced in August 2016) recognises innovative ideas that are implemented, and the project is one of only two Gold awards given in 2016 for the teaching and learning category.

Once again, congratulations to the team: we are proud of all our teachers’ commitment to innovative teaching and their dedication to the care for our students!
