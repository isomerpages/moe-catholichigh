LTC (Ret) Albel Singh shared with our school on his invaluable experience serving to protect Singapore from&nbsp;internal and external threats, e.g. guarding the coast during the high-tension period known as Konfrontasi and his later experience of peacekeeping during the 1969 race riots.

LTC (Ret) Albel Singhâ€™s sharing reminds us of&nbsp;the importance of practicing, maintaining and treasuring religious and racial tolerance, acceptance, respect and understanding.

Happy 52nd Birthday, Singapore!&nbsp;#NS50salute
