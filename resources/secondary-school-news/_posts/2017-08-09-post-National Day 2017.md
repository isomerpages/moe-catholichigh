LTC (Ret) Albel Singh shared with our school on his invaluable experience serving to protect Singapore from internal and external threats, e.g. guarding the coast during the high-tension period known as Konfrontasi and his later experience of peacekeeping during the 1969 race riots.

LTC (Ret) Albel Singh’s sharing reminds us of the importance of practicing, maintaining and treasuring religious and racial tolerance, acceptance, respect and understanding.

Happy 52nd Birthday, Singapore! #NS50salute
