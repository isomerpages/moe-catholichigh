Catholic High School sends our heartiest congratulations to our 2015 Sec 4 cohort for their excellent performance in the 2015 GCE ‘O’ level examinations, with the consistently high percentage of students achieving 9 distinctions or more and the sharp rise in percentage of distinctions for subjects such as English. We are very proud of our gentlemen’s holistic development and their strong academic performance. We wish them all the best in their future endeavours and have full confidence that as they embark on the next exciting phase of their lives, they will continue the legacy of the Catholic High student being a Leader, Gentleman and Bilingual Scholar, living a life of love and service to others.
