#### “City Of Dreams”concert @ Singapore Botanic Garden (6 Aug)


The newly established Eunoia Junior College Symphonic Band presents “City Of Dreams”, a concert that also features the bands from Catholic High School, Singapore Chinese Girls’ School and CHIJ St Nicholas Girls’ School.

The collaboration between these schools marks the first time the 4 schools, all of which are now connected, are working synergistically towards a realisation of an artistic dream.

“City of Dreams” is derived from Benjamin Yeo’s composition of the same name. Mr Yeo is a well sought after local composer who is internationally notable for his original wind band works. “City of Dreams” symbolises and celebrates Singapore’s vibrant band scene while remembering our nation’s history, especially as National Day comes around.

Experience nostalgia as the bands present a variety of uniquely Singaporean songs, from National Day songs such as ‘Home’ and ‘Where I Belong’, to classics such as ‘Kopi-O’ and Bunga ‘Sayang’. Come join us with family and friends and have an enchanting time of singing, dancing and simply reliving the good old days while celebrating our Nation’s 52nd birthday!

<img src="/images/news14.png" style="width:80%">

Our **Edward Becheras Choir** has been invited by The Esplanade to perform on 22 May 2017 as part of their signature Limelight series**.**

Our Edward Becheras Choir is a premier, multi-award winning Soprano Alto Tenor and Bass (SATB) choir under the guidance and instruction of internationally-acclaimed choral director and conductor, Professor Nelson Kwei and Mr Kane Teo. Well regarded in the local choral community and acknowledged as one of the top Secondary School choirs in Singapore, the Edward Becheras Choir hail from humble origins almost half a century ago. The choir has evolved to become a sophisticated group known for producing quality music.

This rare choir showcases male sopranos and altos – usually sung by female voices. Through months of rigorous practising of technique, the choir has honed the skill of singing with a falsetto, creating a beautiful tone quality unique to male upper voices. They pride themselves with a prodigious repertoire of choral songs, ranging from the classics to modern selections, from timely to dynamic pieces, providing choristers with exposure towards the various styles of choral music. Holding a multitude of awards to its name, the choir is also often invited to participate in workshops and masterclasses.

Join them at their debut **performance at** _**Limelight on 22 May 2017**!_
