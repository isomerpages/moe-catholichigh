### A Heritage of Excellence

<img src="/images/about12.png" style="width:240px;height:240px;margin-left:15px;" align = "right"> Our staff, alumni, parent support group and partners are the strengths that our school draws upon for our model of education, where every student is a Leader, Gentleman and Bilingual Scholar in the making. Our heritage of excellence is recognised by the Ministry of Education, which has awarded CHS with the **School Distinction Award** (SDA) and the pinnacle **School Excellence Award** (SEA) for our excellence in both education processes and student outcomes.

<img src="/images/about11.png" style="width:140px;height:140px;margin-right:15px;" align = "left"> Every year, we encourage our students to participate, compete and excel in various activities at the national schools and international level and within our secondary and primary levels. Through these activities, they forge their own legacy of excellence and continue to embody the Catholic High School values of Love, Creativity, Constancy of Purpose and Continuous Improvement. These activities can be broadly categorised into the following areas:

1\.  [Academic Excellence](/secondary/awards-and-achievements/academic-achievements/) <br>
2.  [Co-curricular Excellence](/secondary/awards-and-achievements/cca-achievements/)
