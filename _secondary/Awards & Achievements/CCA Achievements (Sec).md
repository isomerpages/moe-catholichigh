Catholic High School offers a wide range of Co-curricular Activities to provide our students in IP and OP with a platform to discover their interests and talents. Through the guidance by our expert CCA Instructors and dedicated teachers-in-charge, and with the support of parents and alumni, our students have maximised their potential and achieved much in all the areas of CCA.
