### **(A) General Questions about Admission and School**

_(A1) What are the **school fees**?_

*   As CHS is a government-aided school, regardless of the track admitted to, a Singaporean citizen pays $28 per month, including miscellaneous and other fees.
*   Permanent Residents, International Students (ASEAN) and other International Students pay $523, $933 and $1793 per month respectively, including the miscellaneous fees.
*   For most updated information on school fees, please refer to MOE website:&nbsp;[https://www.moe.gov.sg/financial-matters](https://www.moe.gov.sg/financial-matters)

_(A2) What is the **start-time for regular school days**?_

*   Morning assembly **starts at 7.40am** on regular school days.

_(A3) What is the **cohort intake**?_

*   In general, each cohort will have about 150  Integrated Programme (IP) and 150 Singapore - Cambridge Secondary Education Certificate Examinations Programme (SP) students, making up a total of around 300 students per cohort.
*   CHS accepts students from a broad range of schools for both SP and IP, with students coming from more than 80 different primary schools.

_(A4) Do I / does my son need to attend **religious programmes?**_

*   As a government-aided SAP and also mission school (under the auspices of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Singapore), our school emphasises universal values such as love, compassion, integrity and humility in our curriculum and programmes.
*   There are **[spirituality development programmes for Catholic students](/Spirituality-Education-and-Catholic-Programme/)**. These include Religious and Moral Education sessions, Young Christian Student Movement sessions, fortnightly masses, holy days of obligation masses, penitential services, Easter celebration, retreat, etc.
*   **Non-Catholic students are not required but are welcome to attend these Catholic programmes.**
*   Parents are welcome to attend the masses&nbsp;and join the CHS Prayer Parents and Catholic Parents Support Group.

_(A5) What are the **Achievement Level Cut-Off Point (AL COP)**&nbsp;for your SP and IP tracks?_

*   For 2022 Level 1 cohort, the AL COP for SP track is 9 with Merit for HCL (9M) ; the COP for the IP track is 8 with Merit for HCL (8M).

_(A6) How do I know **which track (IP or SP) is more suitable** for me?_

*   The IP track caters to students who will forgo SEC examination and thus have more time to explore interconnections in the curriculum content and concepts through projects and various independent-learning activities.
*   The IP curriculum is designed to dovetail into the A-Level curriculum of Eunoia Junior College, not just for core academic subjects but also for talent development such as the MOE Special Programmes.
*   No less rigorous, the SP track follows a more structured curriculum** which specifically prepares the students for the Singapore-Cambridge Secondary Education Certificate (SEC) examinations at Secondary 4. With the SEC qualification, the students have access to diverse offerings in the post-secondary education landscape.
*   In both tracks, rich and diverse student development and enrichment opportunities offered by CHS will complete our students’ education experience, e.g. Passion Pursuit (Elective) modules are offered to both IP and SP students.
*   The more significant differentiation is that **IP students have more time than SP students for learning new skills and knowledge or participating in applied learning**, e.g. in the middle of each year, Year 4 students embark on work attachment while Sec 4 students complete coverage of the curriculum and start preparations for the SEC examinations.

_(A7) Are students in **SP and IP given the same opportunities**, e.g. for talent development, participation in Olympiad etc.?_

*   Our school-based programmes, e.g. [Passion Pursuit (Elective)](/secondary/distinctive-programmes/passion-pursuit/elective/), are generally offered to both IP and SP students. There is no segregation or exclusion for CCAs, character development and leadership development programmes. Some components of our IP curriculum are offered in the SP as well, e.g. World Readiness Reading Programme.
*   Our [talent development programmes](/secondary/Talent-Development/overview/) (e.g. [CΩERGY](/secondary/Talent-Development/cnergy-programme/)) and [Music Elective Programme](/secondary/Talent-Development/music-elective-programme/) are offered to both IP and SP students who meet the criteria. For example, Maths and Science Olympiads are open to both IP and SP students: criteria is based on students' aptitude and interest for the talent area. Students in our talent development programmes will be involved in the relevant Olympiad.
*   IP students are offered additional programmes such as the [Passion Pursuit (Independent)](/secondary/Distinctive-Programmes/passion-pursuit/independent/), [World Readiness Programme](/secondary/Distinctive-Programmes/world-readiness-programme/)&nbsp;(WRP) and [Bicultural Studies Programme](/secondary/Talent-Development/bicultural-studies-programme/)&nbsp;(BSP) because of the differences in the objectives and curriculum design of SP and IP. With overall less allocated curriculum time due to the SEC examinations, SP students do not offer these programmes.
*   You can learn more about the similarities and differences of our IP and SP at: [Overview of the dual track](/dual-track-curriculum/overview/)

_(A8) Can a student **transfer from the SP to the IP track**?_&nbsp;

*   Secondary 2 students in our SP track may apply to the IP at the end of Sec 2 and join IP Year 3 if he meets the school-based criteria.
*   Students who transfer track will retain their CCA.
*   Change of track for DSA student is subject to his performance and availability of places.

_(A9) What is the **promotion criteria for IP****, including Higher Chinese**, for Year 1 to 4 within CHS?_

*   IP students are expected to obtain the following to promote from Year 1 to 4 within CHS: (1) Overall minimum average of 60%, (2) minimum of 50% for both English and Higher Chinese, and (3) meeting requirements for World Readiness Programme and Passion Pursuit.

_(A10) I am / my son is **exempted from CL/HCL in Primary** school. Can I / he apply to CHS?_

*   No. As with other SAP schools, we do not take in students who offer Mother Tongue Languages other than Chinese/ Higher Chinese.
*   Students exempted from offering CL/ HCL for PSLE in Primary School cannot apply to SAP schools, including Catholic High.

_(A11) Can I **offer/don’t offer Higher Chinese** (HCL)?_

*   CHS is a SAP school, and we aim to have students learn their mother tongue to the highest level possible for each individual student. **Our Integrated Programme (IP) students offer HCL in their first two years (Years 1 and 2)**, and they typically go on to offer HCL in Years 3 and 4. We encourage all our students to offer HCL as far as they could and if they qualify. On top of improving their cultural intelligence quotient and world readiness skill set, offering HCL will open opportunities and pathways for our students long after they have completed secondary education.
*   **SP students can offer both CL or HCL throughout their 4 years with CHS**, so long as they qualify, i.e. they are offered HCL or CL by MOE upon receiving their PSLE results for Sec 1 registration.
*   In addition, for SP students, a pass in HCL will provide 2 bonus points for admission to JCs; both SP and IP students who achieve at least a D7 in HCL will be exempted from offering H1 Chinese in JCs.

_(A12) What are the **available CCAs**? Can my son **join more than one CCA**?_

*   Every CHS student is expected to participate in&nbsp;a CCA from the four CCA groups, namely, Physical Sports, Uniformed Groups, Performing Arts and Clubs &amp; Societies.
*   Students are encouraged to focus on joining one CCA for a balanced and holistic development portfolio.
*   CHS offers the following CCAs for 2023 Level 1 students (of which **all are core CCAs**, i.e. students' main CCA):
    *   **_Physical Sports_**: Basketball, Floorball, Softball, Table Tennis, Track &amp; Field (Including Cross-Country), Volleyball and Wushu

    *   **_Club/Society_**: i-Media, Occulus, Nucleii (I.O.N.) (Audio/Visual, Photography/ Videography, Computational Thinking)

_(A13) How do I travel to CHS via **public transport**?_

*   Situated in the heart of Bishan, our school is accessible via buses and the MRT. Bishan MRT station, with its North-South and Circle Lines, is only several minutes’ walk from CHS.
*   Bishan Street 22 runs alongside the CHS campus, and it is plied by buses 13, 52, 54, 88, 162, 162M and 410.

_(A14) How do I learn more about **Eunoia Junior College** (EJC)?_

_(A16) Can my son bring his **mobile phone** to school?_

*   CHS allows students to bring their mobile phones to school as a means for contacting their family. However, lower level (Levels 1 and 2) students must lock away their phones (through a structured process) until the end of the timetabled lessons, so as to ensure they stay focused on lessons and make good use of their time during breaks.
*   Upper level students are not required to lock away their phones, but are expected to be disciplined and keep their phones during lessons.

_(A17) Does my son need to buy a laptop/mobile devices as part of school programme when he joins CHS?_

*   All our Levels 1 to 4 students will need to own a school-prescribed personal learning device (PLD) under the new national digital literacy programme (NDLP). They will use the device&nbsp; in tandem with the school’s learning environment and the Singapore Student Learning Space (SLS).&nbsp;
*   The purchase of PLDs under the MOE Device Bulk Tender has to be made through the school in February 2022.&nbsp; This starts from Level 1, typically &nbsp;in February of each year.
*   The device of choice for CHS is the Lenovo 500e Chromebook.

_(A18) How will my son pay for this laptop/mobile device?_

*   The Ministry of Education bulk tender has lowered the cost of these devices for the students. Singaporean students can use their Edusave Account to pay for the device selected by the school. A one-off Edusave top-up of $200 was provided in April 2020 to all eligible Singaporean students. With this one-off top-up and annual Edusave contributions, your son should have sufficient funds in their Edusave Account to pay for the device.

_(A19) What will my son be using this laptop/mobile device for?_

*   This device will be used to support the implementation of Blended Learning. As part of Blended Learning, your son will learn what is prescribed by the curriculum through a mix of home-based and in-school activities, whilst leveraging both online and offline approaches to learning.
*   Your son will be able to learn at his own pace and to be empowered to take charge of his own learning. There will also be an emphasis on student-initiated learning, whereby dedicated time and space will be provided to allow him to pursue his own interests and learn outside of the curriculum.
