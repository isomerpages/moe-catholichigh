<h3>Math Talent Development Programme (MTDP)</h3>
<p>The Mathematics Talent Development Programme (MTDP) aims to develop students
who have a strong aptitude in Mathematics to become creative problem solvers
and to pursue their passion beyond school curriculum. Students in our MTDP
comprise of Direct School Admission (DSA) students as well as qualified
high performing upper levels students.</p>
<p>In our MTDP, students are engaged in various rich learning experiences
such as:</p>
<p><strong>Mathematics Research</strong>&nbsp;(Math-REACH) – Students will
attend a series of training to equip them with mathematics research skills.
Thereafter, they will embark on a self-directed learning journey where
they investigate a mathematical problem of their interest and learn advanced
mathematical concepts required in this particular research.</p>
<p><strong>Mathematical Modelling</strong>&nbsp;– International Mathematical
Modelling Challenge (Singapore) allows students to be equipped with skills
to create a mathematical model and solve problems from real-world scenarios.</p>
<p><strong>Statistical Research</strong>&nbsp;–&nbsp;In this research, students
use a variety of statistics knowledge to plan, collect and analyse their
data to present meaningful findings for a real-world scenario context problem.</p>
<p><strong>Mathematics Training, Workshops and Competitions</strong>&nbsp;–
Trainings, workshops and competitions emphasise on problem solving, creativity
and developing students’ interest in the learning of mathematics. Some
examples of competitions are Singapore Mathematics Olympiad and Singapore
Mathematics Project Festival. Workshops on mathematical investigations,
puzzles and paradoxes are also conducted to encourage critical thinking.</p>
<p><strong>External Collaboration</strong>&nbsp;– In close collaboration
with Young Defence Scientists Programme (YDSP), Catholic High School MTDP
aims to nurture students’ passion in areas such as data analytics, artificial
intelligence and Python Programming. Through this collaboration, students
are able to gain valuable insights and be inspired to apply the knowledge
that they learnt on real life engineering, infocomm technology and cybersecurity.</p>
