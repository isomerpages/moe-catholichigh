#### Overview
Catholic High School started the Bicultural Studies Programme (Chinese), BSP(C) in 2016. We offer this programme to Year 3 students who are passionate about learning from the cultures of the East and West. 

This is a [four-year programme](https://www.moe.gov.sg/education-in-sg/our-programmes/bsp-sec). Students successfully admitted to BSP(C) will complete their Year 3 and Year 4 of BSP in Catholic High School and continue the programme at Eunoia Junior College. 

#### Vision
“Every CHS BSP student is a bicultural and bilingual leader with the perspectives, principles and passion to touch lives and transform futures.”

#### Objectives
The objectives of the BSP(C) are to:
1. Nurture principled, bicultural and enterprising leaders who are able to engage with China and understand the West;
2. Develop bilingual scholars who are passionate about analyzing and projecting the historical, cultural and contemporary developments of both the East and West; and
3. Broaden our students’ horizon, and cultivate their global perspectives and world readiness as part of the global diaspora.

#### Course Outline
This programme aims to deepen students’ understanding of history, social evolution, economic developments and international relations of contemporary China with the rest of the world, particularly the West. Students will be exposed to historical analyses, experiential learning and other approaches that cultivate their interest and deepen their learning.

Besides covering topics related to China, students will also learn more about their roots and roles as Southeast Asian Chinese and how the development of China will affect them.

Students will have the opportunities to carry out research studies, attend various seminars and workshops organized by MOE and the school.
