</style>
Catholic High School started the Bicultural Studies Programme (Chinese), BSP(C) in 2016. We offer this programme to Year 3 students who are passionate about learning from the cultures of the East and West. Year 1 and 2 students may prepare themselves for the BSP selection process (at end of Year 2), by applying for development programmes such as our Cultural Ambassador Programme (华青班).

This is a four-year programme. Students successfully admitted to BSP(C) will complete their Year 3 and Year 4 of BSP in Catholic High School and continue the programme at the Eunoia Junior College.
