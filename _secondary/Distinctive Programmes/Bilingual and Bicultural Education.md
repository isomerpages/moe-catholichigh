_Ever heard a 13-year-old give a political speech in the persona of one of the animals in Animal Farm? Imagine a 14-year-old&nbsp;reciting Shakespeare? What about a_&nbsp;15-year-old&nbsp;_crafting a school timetable of his dreams, and writing a oral_&nbsp;defence&nbsp;_of it? A_&nbsp;16-year-old&nbsp;_writing his own public policy paper? These are but a few of the many imaginative and challenging tasks we assign to our students._

*   With a strong focus on effective bilingualism, we have programmes and a curriculum that aim to instil a love for the English and Chinese languages.
*   We want our students to communicate effectively in both languages, and to have the desire to continually improve their language ability even after graduating from CHS. They should also be cognizant of the modern usage of both languages in traditional and online media, and are critical readers.
*   Hence, both our English and Chinese curriculum have additional components of Media Literacy, Public Speaking, Theatre Craft and Creative Writing.
*   At the same time, we have opportunities for students to develop and demonstrate bilingual and bicultural competencies, for example, our Lit Night at CHS, the Singapore Seminar, 华青班、燎原报&nbsp;and overseas immersion trips to China and Western countries.
