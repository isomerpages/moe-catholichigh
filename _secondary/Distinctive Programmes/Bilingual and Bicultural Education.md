_Ever heard a 13-year-old give a political speech in the persona of one of the animals in Animal Farm? Imagine a 14-year-old reciting Shakespeare? What about a_ 15-year-old _crafting a school timetable of his dreams, and writing a oral_ defence _of it? A_ 16-year-old _writing his own public policy paper? These are but a few of the many imaginative and challenging tasks we assign to our students._

*   With a strong focus on effective bilingualism, we have programmes and a curriculum that aim to instil a love for the English and Chinese languages.
*   We want our students to communicate effectively in both languages, and to have the desire to continually improve their language ability even after graduating from CHS. They should also be cognizant of the modern usage of both languages in traditional and online media, and are critical readers.
*   Hence, both our English and Chinese curriculum have additional components of Media Literacy, Public Speaking, Theatre Craft and Creative Writing.
*   At the same time, we have opportunities for students to develop and demonstrate bilingual and bicultural competencies, for example, our Lit Night at CHS, the Singapore Seminar, 华青班、燎原报 and overseas immersion trips to China and Western countries.

**你知不知道公教中学特有的双语双文化节 (Bilingual and Bicultural Festival)？**

我们特别主办了公教中学特有的双语双文化节。这为期两周的活动包括特别为各年级主办的年级活动，如中一的弘孝会、中二的双文化竞、中三的文化讲座和中四的双语辩论；还包括广受同学们喜爱的文化竞赛活动。

_“华青班所举办的双语双文化节让我对东西方文化有了更深一层的了解。双语双文化节的各种各样的活动，让我们对东西方的传统和文化更感兴趣。这些活动不但好玩，而且让我们增广见闻，提升我们的文化素养。” – 洪意恒 (Year 4/2018)_

__“在公教中学，每一次机会都是历练自己的良好契机，在这四年当中，我真的是获益匪浅。在公教，能够展现自己能力的机会连绵不绝，而这些独一无二的学习机会除了让我大开眼界，也让我在不断探索新领域的同时，练就更多新本领。我对语文的热忱也在不断提升中与日俱增。” — 洪義杰（Year 4、2021）__

_‘ The English department teachers in Catholic High are very inspiring and have on multiple occasions prompted me to think above and beyond what is in the syllabus, and apply the skills I learn to analyse and understand the real world.’ – Gideon Law 4-3 2016_
