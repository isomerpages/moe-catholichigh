</style>
In Catholic High, we strive to&nbsp;**develop the cultural intelligence**&nbsp;of our students through authentic and situated learning. Authentic learning for world-readiness can take the form of our students going on experiential learning and internships, and this can be greatly enhanced through immersion in an overseas context, engaging other cultures and making a positive impact on the lives of people around the world.

##### Objectives

These overseas immersion trip aim to:

*   Nurture students’&nbsp;**Cultural Intelligence**&nbsp;(e.g. global awareness, cross-cultural skills and sensitivities) and world-readiness;
*   Expose students to&nbsp;**transformation and progress in Asia and around the world**, and sensitise them to the place of Singapore in the world;&nbsp;_and_
*   Provide platforms and opportunities for students to work collaborative and learn through&nbsp;**real-life experiences and problem-solving**, while communicating their learning effectively and clearly to others.

Our school leverages stakeholders and community such as alumni experts to provide support, advice and resources, especially in the area of&nbsp;**overseas cultural experiences, industrial visits and attachments**.&nbsp;Our students have travelled to China, Japan, Thailand, USA, United Kingdom, Vietnam and other countries for immersion.&nbsp;In turn, we have forged collaborations and partnerships with overseas schools, and our students have hosted teacher and/or students from China, Taiwan and Japan for immersion in our school.
