In Catholic High, we strive to develop the cultural intelligence of our students through authentic and situated learning. Authentic learning for world-readiness can take the form of our students going on experiential learning and internships, and this can be greatly enhanced through immersion in an overseas context, engaging other cultures and making a positive impact on the lives of people around the world.


##### Objectives

These overseas immersion trip aim to:

*   Nurture students’ Cultural Intelligence (e.g. global awareness, cross-cultural skills and sensitivities) and world-readiness;
*  Expose students to transformation and progress in Asia and around the world, and sensitise them to the place of Singapore in the world; *and*
*   Provide platforms and opportunities for students to work collaborative and learn through real-life experiences and problem-solving, while communicating their learning effectively and clearly to others.

Our school leverages stakeholders and community such as alumni experts to provide support, advice and resources, especially in the area of overseas cultural experiences, industrial visits and attachments. Our students have travelled to China, Japan, Thailand, USA, United Kingdom, Vietnam and other countries for immersion. In turn, we have forged collaborations and partnerships with overseas schools, and our students have hosted teacher and/or students from China, Taiwan and Japan for immersion in our school.

##### Types of Cultural Immersion

We offer 2 main types of cultural immersion trips and hosting programmes:

1.  **Flagship Trips**&nbsp;
    *   These are trips that are specific to CHS offering the MOE BSP programme as well as our long partnership with Toyonaka High School. Students can travel to destinations such as USA, UK, China and Japan for learning and exposure associated with global and localised development in Western and East Asian countries in areas of technologies, politics, economics, and the arts.
2.  **Cultural Enterprise**&nbsp;
    *   These are trips that lend a greater focus on ASEAN and East Asia as fast-developing regions which Singapore can tap on. Students can travel to places such as Vietnam and Thailand for learning and exposure associated with the cultural, economic and political formation of East Asia and ASEAN.
