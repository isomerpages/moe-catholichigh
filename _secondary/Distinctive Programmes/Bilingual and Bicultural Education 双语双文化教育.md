# Bilingual and Bicultural Education 双语双文化教育

### Our Philosophy
*“The way of the Catholic High School is a way made of two rails – Chinese and English, free from any entanglement, straight to its end. Happy are those who follow. They shall obtain the scope of a sound education”* — Reverend Father Becheras

Inspired by the vision of Reverend Father Becheras, Catholic High School is committed to a distinctive bilingual and bicultural education. We believe that proficiency in both English and Chinese, coupled with a deep appreciation of Eastern and Western cultures, equips our students to thrive as globally-minded individuals and future leaders.

### A Collaborative Approach
The English and Chinese Language Departments work in close partnership to create a rich and immersive bilingual environment for our students.
### Curriculum & Pedagogy
We foster a love for literature through the Lower Secondary English Literature curriculum and the Appreciation of Chinese Culture (ACC), encouraging students to pursue their passion in English Literature or Chinese Literature at higher levels.

### Signature Programmes
* Singapore Seminar: Students undertake interdisciplinary projects and present their findings in both English and Chinese, developing the ability to articulate complex ideas bilingually.
* Bilingual Broadcasting Station: Students co-host bilingual podcasts or live broadcasts, honing their oracy and presentation skills in both languages.
* Bilingual Morning Assemblies: Morning assemblies alternate between English and Chinese, normalizing the use of both languages in formal settings.
* Annual Bilingual & Bicultural Festival: This annual event provides a platform for students to excel in translation and bilingual debates sharpening their critical thinking and cross-cultural communication skills.

Through these carefully designed curricula and programmes, we are dedicated to nurturing Catholic High students to be proficient in both languages, deeply rooted in cultural heritage, and equipped with a global outlook.

### 教育理念
*"公教中学犹如双轨火车，中英并重，脱然无累，直朝它的目的地驶去。谁跟随他的步伐，必能得到健全的教育，真是幸福。"* — 劳爱华神父

### 跨部门合作
为实现这一愿景，英文部与华文部紧密协作，共同为学生营造一个丰富、沉浸式的双语学习环境。

### 课程与教学
我们通过中学低年级的英国文学课程与文化通识课程，培养学生对文学的热爱，并鼓励他们在高年级修读英国文学或华文文学。

### 特色项目
* 新加坡研讨会：学生进行跨学科专题研究，并以中英双语呈现研究成果，培养运用双语阐述议题的能力。
* 双语广播站：学生共同主持中英双语广播，磨练双语口语表达能力。
* 双语晨会：每周一、三、五举行英文晨会，二、四举行华文晨会，让学生自然地使用两种语言。
* 双语双文化节：这一旗舰活动为学生提供展示平台，开展翻译与双语辩论，锻炼其批判性思维与跨文化沟通能力。

通过这一系列精心设计的课程与活动，我们致力于培养兼具语言能力、文化素养与国际视野的公教学子。
