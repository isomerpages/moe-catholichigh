# Bilingual and Bicultural Education 双语双文化教育

### Our Philosophy 教育理念
*“The way of the Catholic High School is a way made of two rails – Chinese and English, free from any entanglement, straight to its end. Happy are those who follow. They shall obtain the scope of a sound education”— Reverend Father Becheras*

Inspired by the vision of Reverend Father Becheras, Catholic High School is committed to a distinctive bilingual and bicultural education. We believe that proficiency in both English and Chinese, coupled with a deep appreciation of Eastern and Western cultures, equips our students to thrive as globally-minded individuals and future leaders.

### A Collaborative Approach
The English and Chinese Language Departments work in close partnership to create a rich and immersive bilingual environment for our students.
### Curriculum & Pedagogy
We foster a love for literature through the Lower Secondary English Literature curriculum and the Appreciation of Chinese Culture (ACC), encouraging students to pursue their passion in English Literature or Chinese Literature at higher levels.

### Signature Programmes
* Singapore Seminar: Students undertake interdisciplinary projects and present their findings in both English and Chinese, developing the ability to articulate complex ideas bilingually.
* Bilingual Broadcasting Station: Students co-host bilingual podcasts or live broadcasts, honing their oracy and presentation skills in both languages.
* Bilingual Morning Assemblies: Morning assemblies alternate between English and Chinese, normalizing the use of both languages in formal settings.
* Annual Bilingual & Bicultural Festival: This annual event provides a platform for students to excel in translation and bilingual debates sharpening their critical thinking and cross-cultural communication skills.

Through these carefully designed curricula and programmes, we are dedicated to nurturing Catholic High students to be proficient in both languages, deeply rooted in cultural heritage, and equipped with a global outlook.
