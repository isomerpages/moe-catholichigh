### Passion Pursuit (Independent)

**Passion Pursuit (Independent)**&nbsp;is one of two&nbsp;**Joint Integrated Programme Flagship**&nbsp;Programmes. It is Catholic High School’s&nbsp;**Research and Mentorship Programme**&nbsp;for IP students only, which emphasises equipping them with the necessary knowledge and skills to engage in research projects at a higher level.

The&nbsp;**objectives of PP(Indp)**&nbsp;are to:

*   Develop 21st Century Competencies and entrepreneurial dare in students;
*   Help students discover passions by undertaking new challenges; and
*   Develop new skills in students and guide them to acquire knowledge beyond the classroom

#### Our Approach

*   **From Year 1 to 3, students engage in cross-disciplinary research projects**&nbsp;with project themes cutting across different domains and disciplines to support students in discovering their interest and passion in different subject areas. Lesson will also be conducted&nbsp;to hone their thinking, research and communication skills, as well as develop 21st Century Competencies.
*   **Year 4 students embark on a&nbsp;Work Attachment Programme**&nbsp;to put into practice their 21st Century Competencies and research skills in an authentic working environment. They then undertake a&nbsp;**Entrepreneurship Programme**&nbsp;in Semester 2,&nbsp;where students will work collaboratively to identify a problem they faced during the course of attachment and come up with a solution as an&nbsp;entrepreneurship project. All these culminates in a&nbsp;**Capstone Project Congress**&nbsp;as part of our Year 4 students’ graduation.
