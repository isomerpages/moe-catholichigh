This programme offers our students the opportunities to explore aerospace and space engineering, such as unmanned autonomous vehicles and satellite technology. Our staff, facilities such as the STARS lab and partnerships enable us to offer a broad range of training and industry learning opportunities. This programme also complements the rigorous and authentic learning experiences provided by our Life Sciences Programme.

The programme has three main themes – Machine, Body and Sustainability. This instructional approach allows for greater integration of various concepts in the CHS science curriculum and promotion of learning with understanding. Supported by the school’s reading programme, students are exposed to topics like space food, astronomy and challenges of Mars exploration.
