</style>

The Humanities Talent Development Programme seeks to maximise the learning experiences of students through experiential learning and infusing critical thinking skills via an enriched curriculum. This is achieved by providing them with a very R.E.A.L. humanities experience centered on being Relevant, Experiential, Authentic and for Life-long Learning. This programme focuses on the disciplines of Economics, Geography, History and Literature.

#### Aims/Objectives

This programme aims to:

1.  Imbue a sense of fun into the study of the Humanities;
2.  Develop potential humanities scholars for the prestigious Humanities Scholarship Programme (HSP) at the Junior College level; and,
3.  Promote interest in regional studies.

#### Key Features

Students selected for this programme can expect to participate in the following:

3.  Learning Journeys

*   The local and overseas Learning Journeys aim to provide students with authentic experiential learning outside the classroom, during which students will be able to immerse themselves in what Humanities-related knowledge and methods look like in the real world. Our students have travelled to the US and UK to learn more about politics and economy of the western world
