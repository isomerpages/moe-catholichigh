The Mathematics Talent Development Programme (MTDP) aims to develop students who have a strong aptitude in Mathematics to become creative problem solvers and to pursue their passion beyond school curriculum. Students in our MTDP comprise of Direct School Admission (DSA) students as well as qualified high performing upper levels students.

In our MTDP, students are engaged in various rich learning experiences such as:

**Mathematics Research**&nbsp;(Math-REACH) – Students will attend a series of training to equip them with mathematics research skills. Thereafter, they will embark on a self-directed learning journey where they investigate a mathematical problem of their interest and learn advanced mathematical concepts required in this particular research.

**Mathematical Modelling**&nbsp;– International Mathematical Modelling Challenge (Singapore) allows students to be equipped with skills to create a mathematical model and solve problems from real-world scenarios.

**Statistical Research**&nbsp;–&nbsp; In this research, students use a variety of statistics knowledge to plan, collect and analyse their data to present meaningful findings for a real-world scenario context problem.

**Mathematics Training, Workshops and Competitions**&nbsp;–Trainings, workshops and competitions emphasise on problem solving, creativity and developing students’ interest in the learning of mathematics. Some examples of competitions are Singapore Mathematics Olympiad, International Competitions and Assessments for Schools (ICAS) and Singapore Mathematics Project Festival. Workshops on mathematical investigations, puzzles and paradoxes are also conducted to encourage critical thinking.

**External Collaboration**&nbsp;– In close collaboration with Young Defence Scientists Programme (YDSP), Catholic High School MTDP aims to nurture students’ passion in areas such as data analytics, artificial intelligence and Python Programming. Through this collaboration, students are able to gain valuable insights and be inspired to apply the knowledge that they learnt on real life engineering, infocomm technology and cybersecurity.
